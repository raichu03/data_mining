Few will be allowed to stay in Nepal but at least the 90% of the Indians has to go. This is all for the sake of peace as Indians are susceptible to violence and they have political aspirations in Nepal. I don't want to go anywhere near the Psychological trauma Indians carry because of the British and their own history of genocide which is still fresh and happened in the modern times.     The Yadavs, Rawat, Sah, Kumar, Ansari, Jaiswal and so on are not Nepalese at all and deserves to be in their own homeland. There's a real danger of increase in hate due to these folks being used as a political pawns. Then Nepal and India has to renegotiate almost all the treaty that has ever been signed. These people in Terai mass migrated to Nepal during the great famines of India. That's the history of their ancestors coming to Nepal. I am emphasizing on this due to the recent hate against the Chinese that has been going around instigiated by the Indians living in Nepal. They should take that business of hate somewhere else. I smell violence in Nepal if these people are not deported. Its a must. Nepal is not responsible for India's poverty and abusive culture.

A whole month had been too much for us cuz of the doctor's negligence after operation. 2nd stage is very much curable with good doctors and treatment.

nepal ko load shedding  ko memory?,"Unfortunate times, Later Cool Man Ghising exposed this nexus of deliberate loadshedding caused by corrupt men of NEA and powerful businessman involved in generator, inverter, energy business. The whole country was kept hostage by just a group of people. When this news broke out I really thought how naive and gullible Nepalese people are.     Here are some achievements by Cool Man Ghising:  1.  Thanks to the efficient management of Kulman Ghising, there was no load-shedding in the Kathmandu Valley on the day of Laxmi Puja in October, 2016. This was a rare case before as there is huge power demand on this day of the Tihar festival.  2. In the months that followed, Ghising declared Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur loadshedding-free zones, one after another. He also declared Nepal as a load-shedding free country in April, 2018 by ensuring adequate supply of electricity to the industries as well.   3. NEA’s accumulated loss stood at Rs 34.60 billion in fiscal year 2015/16 (2072/73 BS). In his four-year term in office, Ghising not only reduced the loss to zero, but also turned it into a profit-making entity with an accumulated profit of Rs 4.86 billion.  4. The NEA was in loss of Rs 8.89 billion until fiscal year 2015/16 (2072/73 BS). But this public utility company has been transformed into a profit-making state-owned enterprise with an accumulated profit of Rs 11 billion.  5. Electricity leakage stood at more than one fourth of NEA’s total power supply. Ghising had brought that down to 15.27 percent from 25.78 percent. (Year 2020)  6.   In year 2020, Per capita electricity consumption had reached 250 units, up from 131 units recorded on year 2016.  7.   Access to electricity increased by nearly one-fourth of the total households in the country in Ghising’s four-year term. During 2016, only 62.16 percent of households in the country had access to electricity. That figure stands at 86.44 percent in 2020.  8. NEA imported 1.77 billion units of electricity from India in fiscal year 2015/16, spending Rs 13.12 billion.  Four years later, the country imported only 1.72 billion units of the total 7.74 billion units of electricity consumed in the country.   9.   NEA could complete the construction of Chameliya Hydropower Project (15 MW), Upper Trishuli III A Hydropower Project (60 MW) and Kulekhani Reservoir-based Hydropower Project (14MW).  10. Until fiscal year 2015/16, hydroelectricity projects with the power generation of 801 MW were in operation across Nepal. But now, this has increased by 57 percent, taking the total power generation capacity of the country to 1257 MW. Dozens of power projects with a total capacity of around 3,000 MW are currently under-construction. Year 2020.",False,False,False,False,False,False

I need a job. I have no money to survive anymore.,"I'm working as a contractor (Jr. Software Engineer) with a US startup company, and honestly, they are paying me really well even though I work part-time. I can't help you with a job directly, but I can give you some suggestions on how to land one.  Building your public profile is incredibly important. People often think there's wild competition for tech jobs, but that's not entirely true. When people apply for jobs online, 70% of applicants lack basic skills—they don't know fundamental stuff. Many can't work quickly enough, and companies have to fire them because they can't handle the pressure.  If you're someone who only has experience with basic to-do or eCommerce projects, or if you haven't worked with a large codebase, please start doing so. Check out open-source projects and get familiar with larger codebases. When you build a project, don't just build it for the sake of building; create a product that could generate passive income. Think of a problem you can solve, make it a paid solution, and work on it. Your project will be far more impressive than others.  Share your work online on LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms. Reach out to people and make connections. Message people on Twitter or LinkedIn asking for help—don't worry if they say no. Just make sure you are skilled and the right person for the job.  I know these are very generic things that you may already know, but if you keep following this advice, it will surely help you.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Life is hard in Kathmandu if you don't own a private vehicle.,"TL;DR: Public transport in Kathmandu is frustratingly poor with limited buses after 7 pm, rampant harassment, pickpocketing, and overcrowding. Conductors often overcharge, especially tourists or newcomers. Despite promises, little is done to improve the situation. Pathao and Indrive are helpful alternatives but not always affordable. Strong public transport unions and frequent changes in ministers stall progress. Even minor improvements in bus services would be a significant relief.

Life is hard in Kathmandu if you don't own a private vehicle.,"To further add to your point abt the syndicate, I experienced smth that was so fucking stupid. Happened in Pokhara, we were abt to return to Kathmandu, went to the hiace's stop for vehicles. We learn that the hiace samiti was protesting cuz a driver was arrested/taken in by the cops for charging extra on passengers midway. This happened a few months ago, and it's kinda crazy how these people have so much power over our law enforcement. They were deliberately hiding these vehicles and we finally got into one after finding out the hidden location, which was just 2 mins away in an open ground.   To improve our public transport, we need better regulations and law enforcements. We've got the buses but we need proper rules and regulations. Making a proper schedule for buses arrivals and departures, dedicated bus stops, example: One in Bijulibazar, the other in New Baneshwor (make people walk a lil, special exceptions being emergencies and disabilities). Also, no tolerance for overcrowding the bus with people. Idk the pay structure of bus staff but if they start getting a fixed salary rather than the salary determined from the volume of people, then the low volume of people shouldn't be a problem.",True,False,False,False,False,False

Life is hard in Kathmandu if you don't own a private vehicle.,"Buses alone are not the problem. Economic disparity hernu parcha. Social construct ra status symbol hernu parcha.  Many hune-khane don't ride buses because they don't see people like them riding the bus. When this happens, a huge chunk of upper-middle and upper class people are excluded from the equation. This then reduces the need and purpose for bus operators to cater the demographic (response to someone commenting down below that you should operate 30 seater bus with 35 people) - is not going to happen. There is no demand for traveling luxuriously within the city. So bus operators do not allow the required route or timing for such buses.  Again, cars and bikes are luxury (how customs dept. of Nepal correctly defines them as bilasita ka bastu) instead of a daily necessity. Getting a car is to show relatives and colleagues rather than getting from point A to point B. A lot of people invest in expensive cars because that's what others see. Nobody is going to come and check your kitchen or your bank account - but everyone will definitely and certainly check your car.

Nothing stays the same forever. Nothing will stay the same forever. Study harder. People are willing to spend lakhs to go to another country to labour but are not enterprising enough to invest that money in some business or one's own skills to do better. People who think that just getting an engineering degree is enough to get a job are naive. Have you seen the competition? And people who will just get a degree or worse just clear high school, think that that's enough to land a high profile job are also naive. You also mean to say that the only successful people in Nepal are from rich and connected families and that there is no place for hardworking, enterprising people in this country? Get a higher degree, study harder and get better grades. Spend time improving your language skills. Get some other technical certifications as well. Work as an apprentice, if needed, for some months or even a year. If possible learn a foreign language. All that can be done for less than going to most foreign countries. You need patience and perseverance. Nepal is not doomed. If the Nepali youth give up and leave for other countries, then the youth from some other countries will come here and work. Life is what you make of it. There ARE people who NEED to go abroad to earn as their skill set is not enough.

Pret aatma wants to live near its clan but its nature is destructive and it demands attention and care to ease its pain. If ignored it will destroy the clan . So it needs to be tamed, contained and pleased for it to be of good nature and if done right,  it will turn from Pret to Bayu and protect the clan from harm. To be mindful Bayu is different than Kul devata which needs different discussion. So in order to Contain Bayu, the Shaman does rituals to tame the Pret aatma then it chooses a clan member and inters their body, it possesses and starts expressing its pain. By questioning it and finding things to make its pain numb , it is asked how much Khali it wants to eat to be satisfied . 'Khali Khanu’ is the process of burning of piles of woods to hot red coals and the clan member choosen by pret dances on the coal until it turns into ashes, after which the caotic pret aatma becomes calmer Bayu .  So from the this perspective,  Your grandfather was a pret and now if already tamed, you have a Bayu in yours or one of your uncles house.

Or you could even cost cut further if you can manage basic needs yourself better on around 12k expenses for room, board, cooking and laundry, then save whatever you can every month.

Negotiate like your life depends on it. Which it does, sadly. Nobody's going to go ""Ae baabu bichara lu aau 8k ma basa"".

Waiting for a miracle to happen,"Life is never fair. But it doesn't mean you have to be unfair to you, and everyone that's involved in your life - rather, you should strive to be unconditionally fair to yourself, then everyone else around you. Keep your eyes out, and you'll notice that life often loves being unfair to your advantage as well, just like it equally loves being unfair to your detriment. It's how you perceive it, and how to tackle it: Your attitude towards life.  Why wander looking for happiness when it's been right there, within you? Need for more money, more responsibilities, more fame, more this, and that, these are just you adding problems to yourself for you to solve. I'm not saying stop trying to grow as a person, but don't forget the fact that society unfairly loves glorifying successful people. It doesn't matter if the successes were preceded by a mountain's worth of failures - it's just conveniently tucked away. And the average reptile brain looks at one success, isolated, robbed out of all of its context, and the story of struggle behind it, and thinks ""yeah, I want that"". Without taking in how long, or hard the success had to shed blood, sweat, and tears to get where they are today.  I'm quoting fiction, but it gives you something practical to look upto:  >""**अथ चैत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि**। **ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।**""  >  *Arjun, if you hesitate from fighting this (holy war), you'll sin by forsaking your call to duty... And thus, you shall have no place to complain of the consequences that'll play itself out.*  Stop living life in autopilot, make your own happiness, but remember to be fair, and just, never ""chase"" happiness in the expense of someone else's.  Happiness isn't gotten, received, or earned, my friend. Happiness is something you fight for. You got the recipe in you to be fiercely successful that you couldn't possibly dream of.

Similarly Christianity ma ni as per my research I have come across many such sects who sometimes go above and beyond to convert people into faith but in doing so uses methods that come out as underhanded methods which has been documented and caught. Such actions have categorized all the people who believe in jesus christ to be viewd with the same prespective. Not all Christians go around preaching and waiting around the corners of the house.   Regarding Christian hate and christinization ma chai. I would say. Few people chor vayo vandai ma we don't hate the entire human kind. If such logic is to be used.

And what could gain more views in our country..?? Christian hate ofcourse so tei anusar ko reporter and medias ko influence le pani ho. Yo hate failiyeko. people however do not do research on those matters.  So there are definitely few sects in so called Christianity who have done things which has been shunned by the society. But that being said. We cannot blame the entire Christian population based on failures of few people. I see the lack of research here just as you have mentioned.  Currently I am researching Christan sects and their impacts. I am not completely positive not am i blindly negative. I believe in my studies and findings only. So I was able to share this view of mine. Thank you.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Just because some of you met fake Christians doesn't mean the whole Christian community is wrong okay. If you guys really wanna dig up the past Christians we're killed by you people especially you Hindus. still we don't hate you guys cause in the bible it is said that love your enemies as you love yourself. But guys are still fighting for Nepal Hindu rastra hunu parxa.i mean really?? Is this really you guys want? Do you guys think our ancestors and freedom fighters really want our country to be only Hindus.       Prithivi Narayan Shah said we are different flowers in the same garden. And if you guys have a functioning brain then you should know the meaning of it. I can't believe people are still fighting for Nepal Hindu rastra hunai parxa what the hell you guys will achieve huh??? I watched videos of gaurav also known as get set fly and he said what do you guys think what do you guys prefer Nepal to be totally Hindu rastra or secular national? When I read the comments bruhh then I realised why Nepal is a country with the lowest IQ.So guys let's just stop fighting instead of that let's make this world a better place to live. If you really wanna debate first of all read the bible it is the most selling book for a reason don't just post random things that you found in some random sites and videos. Be mature guys. I wanna clear the misconceptions that we Christians do not pay anyone to be Christians just like you guys said there are some fakes but we don't do such things.

It's important to approach these claims with caution and verify the information before drawing conclusions. While there may be isolated incidents of individuals or groups engaging in such practices, it's unfair to generalize and attribute these actions to the entire Christian community.  Regarding the story you shared about your friend's experience, if true, it's indeed troubling. No one should be forced or coerced into converting to a religion against their will. Respect for individual beliefs and freedom of religion are fundamental rights that should be protected.

 lets talk about Christianization of Nepal.,"I'm an Atheist and Christianity has done most damage to Humanity among all religions. But in case of Nepal it is positive for some extent to oppose negatives of Hinduism. I don't need religion but despite my personal view freedom of religion is still one of basic human right. Normal human does need to be able to practice their religion freely coming right after basic needs to most people.  Dalits for thousands of years despite being Hindu as that's what the society itself believed in were never treated as equals and not even allowed in Temples to practice their own religion. They've been Hindus since forever but their very own religion deprived them of practicing religion, so it's fked up to worship a cult who thinks you're inferior to them. Christianity in Nepal provided those marginalized people with chance to actually practice a religion like normal people do and also filled their basic needs like financial aid for food, clothing, shelter, education. They treated them as equals!!!  Now argument might be that Dalits could move to Buddhism too as it's more local and promotes not just religion but nationality too as it strengthens Buddha's connection to Nepal.. But thing is Buddhism despite being welcoming to everyone, never made attempt to include Dalits or reach out to them.  So in summary Christianity brought equality to Dalits who didn't get justice for millenniums from their own religion. Christianity also brought us ton of money as foreign aid  as donations, made quality of life better for their communities in Nepal.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Even though they had the resources and unlimited supply of Indian soldiers, Anglo - Gorkha war was a logistical nightmare for them and they had learned their lesson the hard way, after battling with the Gorkha Kingdom and not only that simultaneously at that time many Kingdoms in India were also discreetly trying to rise up against the company which they were already aware of. Fighting a war on a flat terrain is not that hard provided you have the resources and enough soldiers to replace your fallen troops and that strategy wasn't going to work in Nepal. So, they knew it was a bad idea and It was not because Nepal had nothing to offer. Nepal held the direct passage to Tibet which was important for them to trade with China and it was not only important for the British but also important for other Indian states.

How to overcome childhood trauma?,"From one survivor of childhood trauma to another, I'm sending you good energy and positive thoughts.   For me, it's been quite the journey of healing which seems never to be complete. It has been filled with isolation, loneliness, and a tangled web of self-hatred and helplessness. However, I've found comfort in showing myself compassion, building a supportive network around my friends and loved ones, seeking therapy, and exploring various resources for healing with the childhood trauma. Mostly, understanding how it was never my fault and I should not be guilty and ashamed. It comes in waves the affirmation and rejection.   Everyday is level one.   Someday, I do have a cheat sheet to go through but most days, I take it one breath at a time. It does help.

Trust yourself to redraw your boundaries.   I also want you to understand that what is working for me might not work for you or any of the resources that you seek, but know this- YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

How to overcome childhood trauma?,"I’ve had similar experiences with sexual harassments from relatives and in public vehicles. The last one was when I was in Class 12 and this is surely because I left abroad after +2. I never thought much about those harassments, but when I started making new friends I noticed I hated it when people came near me, I didn’t even let then hug me in a friendly way until I trusted them and deemed them safe which took years by the way. So at the age of 22, when my anxiety started spiralling and I started getting depressed, I went to a therapist and that was when I knew I was still living in my childhood and teenage years. After few years of therapy and talking to friends about it, I spoke about these with my family few months ago. Because I was still angry. I couldn’t let go. I never fought back when those happened so now I wanted my family to know. This was my way of fighting. Above all, I started feeling better because I started acknowledging and understanding my own traumas.  Saying that, everyone has their own way of coping with traumas. Getting a therapist helps. I always thought therapists were useless but they’re professionals for a reason. Later it also made me feel better when I spoke about these to my close friends, who were angry on my behalf and this meant a lot, I shared everything with my younger brother who took everything so well and now he asks a stranger if they’re okay when they look uncomfortable in public places, I now tell people if they’re on my personal space and they’ve always understood. I now try and speak up. When I went to Nepal few months ago, I avoided the pubic vehicles. I still panic if people stand behind me, I still pretend like I’m tying my laces and let the people walking behind me walk past me after dark, I still place my headphones on a minimum volume if I’m walking alone in dark. I’m still scared. But I’m finally forgiving and moving on. The visions that were so clear have now started getting a little hazy.

Hence it gets more attention and you suddenly feel like these bus guys are everywhere.  These bus guys majorly come Pokhara to visit or the religious place to visit, they don't stay much and they leave. I don't see not spending money as a problem, they creating nuisance and littering is the problem, for which the government is there to make rules and enforce. Government is not capable of enforcing rules related to pollution on its own population, I don't know how they will enforce them on people of different country, OR may be creating a tourist police of some sorts lol.  Live in a border area for a day and you will find 100s of Indian cars coming in and going out of Nepal, These people stay in hotels, spend their money, some stays in normal hotels, and some in 5 stars.  And the people coming from Airplanes. These also do stay in hotels, spend money.  You will see rise of Indian tourist normally during Summer season to beat the heat more , compared to other season.

I hate my own people who trashes everywhere, Idk why you think I would not have same opinion on that regard.   Why are you even being on defensive on this matter? Do you like trashing trash everywhere? I would agree with you if you said the same thing for Nepali tourist on Indian, i don’t give a shit who you are, just don’t trash where you are coming as a guest.",True,False,False,False,False,False

Indian Tourists in Nepal This Year,"You are taking examples to the extreme. No way tourist buses give 10kmpl man. Maruti Suzuki, 800c, gives 15 in the hilly roads with many turns. Maybe in a freeway (which there are 0 in Nepal)  but no way they give 10kmpl in Nepali roads. Maybe you need to do more research?  And also how do they carry food for that many passengers in that low of a space? Even for a small school picnic our school had to bring one additional bus for food and cooking equipments. There's no way they can do all that and visit even just KTM and Pokhara in 2 days. Let's say they are from Gorakhpur. It takes a day to reach KTM without all the stopping for food. If they stop to cook food and then clean up and pack everything back in the bus for each meal, Let's say 2 days to reach KTM. 1 day to visit. One day to reach PKR. One day to explore PKR and Let's say 1 day to come back. Easily adds up to a week at max. It's not logistically possible at all. Maybe they cook certain meals just because of diet restrictions but that's not even economical to do. The extra petrol it consumes and extra gas it consumes amd extra time it takes isnt worth the price. Maybe in an extreme case, if they are coming for pilgrimage and do not eat outside food for religious reason, they can do that. But I don't really think it is that common of an occurance and not financially consistent with saving money. The only scenario I can think of is they don't eat garlic onion potatoes etc and they are here to visit religious places to wash away their sins. Those religious fanatics are just a collateral damage of having more tourism",False,False,False,False,False,False

Why don't financial stable Nepalese people on foreign countries start business in Nepal?,"I run two businesses, one here and one in the US. They do similar work and have similar revenues. I work in a simple and non-controversial field.  Six months ago, I thought I’d switch the businesses over to a web-based telephone host to route calls more effectively (SIP-based). This technology is available in both countries.  In the US, I signed onto a website, filled out a form, entered my credit card, and agreed to pay $5 per month. I had the system up and running in an hour.  In Nepal, the monthly price was ten times as much and required a massive deposit. That wasn’t even the worst part. I was told by NTC that I needed letters of recommendation from three different ministries to purchase the service, and my request would be reviewed over a series of months. They would come inspect my office and ensure that my request was “genuine”. When I asked what that meant, the officer didn’t know. I’ve spent six months trying to sort this out, and I’ve made almost zero progress. All this to buy a commercial phone line.  In the US, I spend about 1% of my time dealing with legal matters. If I have a question about regulations, I can Google it and have an answer. In Nepal, it’s more like 30%. if I have a question, I usually end up spending a full day in a government office somewhere. Even then, I often won’t get a clear reply.  Everything is like this.   I want so desperately to run a business here, to pay taxes and to hire people.

What they are doing might be legal but we as a people should be aware of the motive of such media.

Which disease or condition you are Most Afraid of?,"Well the usual ways to go around it, apart from antacids and acid suppressing meds, is not lying down for a couple hours after eating, so is raising the head of your bed by about 5 degrees -- using bricks, etc.   I had really bad reflux myself. Turns out it was GLUTEN for me all along - a protein found in many grains . Some time in late teens or early 20s I developed a sensitivity to it and would always have reflux, bloating etc... with noodles, rotis, breads, biscuits, momos, burgers/pizzas, samosas... Beer.   I thought it was the same for everyone. Took me a couple years to realize what I had was much worse than a normal variation.   Since cutting out gluten, I've been 99.99% symptom free! Sometimes you just can't avoid it as people use wheat flour for thickening gravies/sauces or marinating/layering for fried stuff, etc.   It's quite a difficult thing to do - hardly any snack options remain, and you miss the food... I do cheat sometimes even though it ain't good for me, but I feel the effects soon enough.   My gut was somehow barely tolerating it when I didn't know. But now that I cut it out from my diet, it recognizes and gets upset quite promptly.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Which disease or condition you are Most Afraid of?,"Dairy makes it worse for me too, but I do cheat there sometimes as well.   However, I would recommend you try an elimination diet for gluten as well. Remove it from your diet for a couple weeks and reintroduce it - like straight *maida* stuff - white bread, noodles. And see if there's some issue there.   Because if dairy is your sole trigger, you shouldn't be having really bad reflux you're avoiding your trigger.   PS: when the connection between lower esophagus and stomach, via the lower esophageal sphincter (valve-ish functioning part) is too loose, it causes reflux no matter what. Most patients with reflux have some degree of that, can't be changed much really, without surgery.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Amway(agents haru ko  kartut),"I fell for this back in 2017-2018 and ended up paying around AUD 400. The only reason i was convinced to pay the money was the changes i saw in my friend who was the one pitching the “business” to me.  In a few months since i had last met him, it seemed like he had a different personality. And when he started going off about personal development, i thought maybe i will give it a try. But i later found out that he was completely brain washed by his mentors, he had even given his mentors his Netbank details, to help him clear his debt, i told him back then as well that, you’re still the one earning the money to pay the debt not your mentor, so don’t give him your bank details, but he trusted them blindly.  I later found out that any materials they give you to read, listen or watch is designed to further their agenda. As mentioned by the OP, they meet in all formal attire, praise each other for getting more victims and act all pretentious. I was added to a facebook group for all the new recruits, but all i saw there was that they were targeting newcomers from Nepal and giving them false hope and leaving them $ 400 poorer, this was the final nail for me and i told my friend that i was quitting.  He gave me various reasons to carry on and any reasoning i gave he had an answer for. This just showed that how he was trained to face this type of situation. But my friend is still at it, probably has a steady stream of income by now, but at what price? I occasionally ask him ‘how’s the business going?’ and he say that its alright and thats the extent of our talk on Amway.  This turned out longer than i intended, but please be aware of these schemes, do your own research and try to find out what you’re getting into.",False,False,False,False,False,False

Feeling quite lonely and depressed ,"I'm 19. I used to feel like that, but i have grown out of it recently. I also had no one to talk to, including my parents. I used to spend my time indoors watching anime, youtube,etc. On a normal day, i would spend like 8-10 hrs on my phone. Recently , i started to use my phone less and less, and it has made me happier. I dont know if it's placebo or something, but after hearing from multiple people from youtube, i finally decreased my screentime and social media usage, and honestly, i have never felt this good in a long time. I have improved sleep. I learned new skills like riding a bike and drawing, and i am learning spanish right now because i have nothing else to do after finishing my 12th. I've also started taking care of my body and exercising regularly. I randomly just show up to my friend's house, whom i am comfortable with ( which is 2 of my friends).   Try it, and if you need someone to talk to, we can  talk right here.   Hope you grow out of this phase. Good luck.",False,False,False,False,False,False
