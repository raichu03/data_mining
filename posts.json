        "selftext": "So Kailash Sirohiya has 3 separate nagarikta numbers (Separate in Kantipur shares, separate in Himalaya Bank shares and separate in his twitter post) and he has written \"Banshaj\" wala nagarikta despite his parents being Indian. This hasnt yet been highlighted in major news. They are only accusing Rabi dai but arent addressing the main issue he has been caught for. ",
        "comments": [
            "They wanna distract people from the real facts. They wanna show people that others are taking revenge on kailash and he owns a news channel, so it is a threat to press freedom.  The people who support this matter saying press freedom is in threat are dumb and brainwashed.",
            "He own Kantipur doesn\u2019t he? They will create, manufacture, lie, cheat and do all they can to help him. Simple.",
            "Yeah they are trying to potray Sirohiya as Patrakar and calling this an attack on Press freedom. Sab ustei chan. Real press freedom ma attack bhako kati incident haru chan but tyo bela kei boldeinan. But aaile inahru ko \"Bade Sahab\" mathi karbahi bhayo ani sabei pugeka chan. Congress le ta aandolan nei garne bhandei chan. Euta bhanai cha ni, Laharo tanda paharo aaucha, ho tei hola jasto lagyo. Main ta congress sanga.  I thik they are afraid ki kei bhai halyo bhane inahru sab fasne wala chan. The way these all have come in support of him is so suscipious.",
            "They think we all are foolish.  All nepali citizens. I think we need to start a boycott campaign against kantipur media and big media houses. Stop following kantipur in YouTube, instagram and fb.",
            "not only kantipur each and every big media outlet are calling it as attack on press freedom. fuck this country",
            "Why don't we all youngsters stop buying anythingthing related to kantipur and stop watching kantipur at all?",
            "They think all of us are foolish \ud83d\ude44 like them. All congressi are supporting him and we all know why. Arey bhai samachar lekheko karanle samateko hora press biruddha huna lai. Citizenship ko issue ho ani rabi dai ko k vayo same case ma tha xa ta sirohiya lai.",

            "I think dude is unstoppable beast able to handicap anyone who comes in his way. Being owner of largest media of country, he can easily brainwash people in anything by his constant propaganda. And about press biruddha ko case, Kantipur employees top level journalist who are active in twitter, ig they sure will receive a bonus for their efforts.   But I have to say he did bring a required law change in Nepal. Guilty until proven innocent.",
            "Not big fan of Rabi but big fan of the people in his party and what Rabi has done that is exceptional and I am loving it. Big fish which noone dared to even touch at least has been arrested",
            "If a traffic police catches a reporter for over-speeding, that's not attack over press freedom. Why should it be different in this case?",
            "Do you get to choose your nagarikta number? Do you decide whether to get \u2018bansaj\u2019 nagarikta? If that\u2019s the real issue then the then CDO and the issuing officers have to be investigated.",
            "Arko narrative chai pahad medesh ko nikalyeko cha teraibasi  manche haru lay. Madesh ko manche lay nagrikita lida pani pahad ko manche lay Nepali namannye vanyera. But the fact is that he owns too many nagrikita and became ancestral Nepali without being one.",

So much of bullshit going on.... Administration is so level here... This is not a country.  Some buch of douchebag running a bunch of themselves..",
            "Because they are above the government.",
            "It is definitely a clerical error from government. All his brothers have angikrit nagarikta. Ghashiram Sirohiya, father of Kailash was close to BP Koirala and family from the days of Kranti. Government did not find papers does not mean they can arrest him. They should first find if it is bonafide mistake or clerical error. Just on confusion of citizenship if people are to be arrested, then all old people who were born before 1960 will be arrested",
            "Ain't Multiple nagarikta numbers,the case of terrorism",
            "Why dont we all report on kantipur page? Claiming its spreading fake allegation or news?",
            "Agreed that the nagarikta issue is a concern but legally speaking, there was no need for the arrest. He could\u2019ve just been summoned to the court and the have a normal court appearance and procedure.   This act against Sirohiya is clearly a vengeance. Rabi was mad about being thrown off as a home minister due to his passport issue and back then he had promised to come after the kantipur media. And now kailash has been arrested. Again, understandable that his nagarikta possses an issue but there was no need for the arrest at all. A summon was enough that\u2019s all.   As for Rabi, yes back then raising an issue of his passport was important because he was a home minister! If home minister does not even follow the federal laws and regulations, it definitely questions his judgement of position. As for business men like Kailash and every others (even the politicians), they always have the darkest secrets hidden from the public. It is important to have them out, but can be done lawfully and respectfully instead of one with hate and pure vengeance that Rabi has pulled against him.",
            "But what is the benefit of having 3 nagarikta? Tyo Pani eutai desh Ko",
            "They  have so much money. They can supress issues like murder  His son sambaw literally killed 3 people in drunk and drive case and no action were taken beacuse of his father He is literally the king maker  If you can kill and stay not pointed at  You are above the law I hate it",
            "if you publish same thing constantly for a long period of time, timro sub conscious mind ma tei bascha k, so its more like mission 84, I think",
            "He owns the paper smh",
            "Kantipur is the biggest hypocrite. For years they have extorted people, black mailed and kept people in fear. The media in Nepal operates as a cartel because of him. His arrest signifies reform for the media in Nepal, not a threat to freedom.   Kantipur's legacy has caught up to them. Karma got to them, and now they're pulling every card they have to use. But the truth is, he got what he deserves. He got what he did.",

I do not see anything more than that! Why are people excited exalted or agitated! The pages are yet to unfold.  The country is going through a difficult recession, people who saved money - I am talking of tens of thousands - lost their life savings, those who still have their money, it is losing value fast. If things do not turn around, it will be a huge load of worthless paper!   Meanwhile the persons that the people voted for and went to the parliament are only running after the chair, to be in power and either earn money or be pawns to old masters of the game or take revenge. The ones we trusted are instead fighting feuds and forgetting us! SHAME ON THEM!   Please work to fulfill our expectations. Focus on priorities and neglect those who shout and propagate propaganda and brainwash people! PERIOD.",

            "There has to be a peaceful exchange of people from Nepal and India. Indians especially the likes of Bihari, Marwaris, South Indians has to be deported back to India which is their rightful home and same goes for the Nepalese. Few will be allowed to stay in Nepal but at least the 90% of the Indians has to go. This is all for the sake of peace as Indians are susceptible to violence and they have political aspirations in Nepal. I don't want to go anywhere near the Psychological trauma Indians carry because of the British and their own history of genocide which is still fresh and happened in the modern times.     The Yadavs, Rawat, Sah, Kumar, Ansari, Jaiswal and so on are not Nepalese at all and deserves to be in their own homeland. There's a real danger of increase in hate due to these folks being used as a political pawns. Then Nepal and India has to renegotiate almost all the treaty that has ever been signed. These people in Terai mass migrated to Nepal during the great famines of India. That's the history of their ancestors coming to Nepal. I am emphasizing on this due to the recent hate against the Chinese that has been going around instigiated by the Indians living in Nepal. They should take that business of hate somewhere else. I smell violence in Nepal if these people are not deported. Its a must. Nepal is not responsible for India's poverty and abusive culture. I feel for these Indians in Nepal but Nepal is no positon to manage them and their history of abuse.",

        "title": "I got sexually harassed for the first time today.",
        "selftext": "I(16F) got touched today by a (17-19M).   I had always gotten catcalled and looked with dirty eyes as long as I can remember but I had never gotten physically harassed. I always walked with a straight unwelcoming face avoiding eye contact in public and today was the same.  When I was heading back home from my training, a boy suddenly comes and slaps my behind and runs away. I had never gotten touched like that so for a few seconds I couldn\u2019t even process what was happening. After realizing, I turned around to see that the boy had already ran away. I was shocked and the people around also looked at me but did nothing. I was still shaken up but started walking again, trying to get as far away as I can. After thinking about the situation and what had just happened to me, tears started rolling down my face. I couldn\u2019t control them. I was scared and upset. Why would a teen like me do that, why did I do nothing, why did nobody around me do nothing, why did I have to take that path, why did have to go to training that day. All these sorts of questions started running through my head. I was trying to hold back my tears as much as I could while trying to reach my home quickly. Everything built up and I became overwhelmed with emotions. That 20 minute walk to my home was the longest. People stared at me while I was trying to hide my tears and run away. I just wanted to get home asap and just curl up into a ball and disappear. As soon as I got home, I started balling my eyes out. I don\u2019t know why I cried and me crying made me more upset. I was so upset at my helplessness in the situation. I don\u2019t know what to do if I encounter that boy again. Should I shout, curse, attack him? I haven\u2019t told anyone yet. Idk I just feel so violated. And I feel as if my experience is not even that bad relative to others. I feel like I am overreacting but I just can\u2019t help but feel scared and pathetic. Even during the walk home, I avoided every man I saw and tried to get far from fear. I was always confident that I would speak up if I got harassed but I did the opposite today. And I just don\u2019t know what to do. I want to scratch away the part that I was touched.  Does anyone know what I should do?  Update: Hello guys! Thank you for all the support, encouragement and comfort. I talked to my mom about the situation today because I gained enough courage from your words. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have cctv around the area and I don\u2019t remember much about the harasser since it was my first time seeing him. But I feel much better. Thank you for all your guy\u2019s advice. I\u2019ll make sure to not let that guy go the next time I see him. Even though I can\u2019t reply to every comment I truly am grateful for all the kindness everyone has shown because it has helped me to put this trauma behind me and become more stronger.\u2764\ufe0f",

            "im really sorry that you had to go through such a horrible experience. you didn't deserve it nor was it your fault. you're brave for sharing your experience. our brain can't really deal with the traumatic experience right away so i promise you that being hopeless isn't your fault either.  i hope you feel better soon\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",
            "One thing I want to say, no you are not overreacting. Your feelings are valid. Your space was violated, you would of course feel the way you feel right now. Please don't feel like you are not justified of your emotions. So sorry that happened to you. Its soo heartbreaking that girls are not safe anywhere and even have to question their own emotions about feeling bad while things like this occurs.   We know there were many possible things you could've done but these things happen like a flash, you can't process it, you're questioning yourself in the moment like did this just happen? The people saw it happen? They saw and did nothing?I want to do something but I'm scared. They did nothing and I'm scared and alone.  The fault here is not yours, you were scared. You would be. Soo sorry it happened to you. It's just soo sad, hope you are doing ok.",

It was  quick and they immediately disappear into crowd. The girl could not even process what  happened to her, she was in total shock. It been 25 years and I still vividly remember how she tried to process it and trying to find people responsible. I am sorry that it happened to you. You emotions are all valid.",
            "This is not your fault.   What happened to you should not happen to anyone!  Please talk to your parents about this incident and see what other step you can take.  Again, this is not your fault.   Hopefully that prick gets a bit of a bad karma in return!",

            "share this incident to your friends or brothers or parents whichever you would feel right and gather up , find out who that guy was and if you find him, slap and ask why he did it .also share this behavior of him to his mom/dad if possible..so that he could get punished for what he has done and would never do it again.",
            "I guess talking to your brother/sister would be so much relieving and if u want to do something about it then please tell your brother to pick u up for 3 days anii if he is spotted again please complain to police after catching him or u could just beat the shit out of that guy",
            "I am sorry OP that this happened to you.  No one should have to go through what you went through.  Also, know that all of your feelings are valid and none of it is your fault.  Please talk to your parents, close trusted friends about this.  Hopefully, It will help you move on from it. Regarding what you should have done, I do not know.  It\u2019s a much bigger problem in the country - how some teenagers/boys/men do not understand what respecting a woman means, that there are no consequences to their behavior, and sad how they think that they have more privilege over women since they have a penis. Since there are no consequences, no education around such an unacceptable behavior, in some ways, our society/government validates their privileged background of being a male.",
            "No! You\u2019re not overreacting! I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this experience. Being scared is valid but you\u2019re not pathetic, that mindless imbecile who put you through this is the pathetic one. Your experience is not for others to validate, u know how traumatic it was for you and that\u2019s all that matters, don\u2019t gaslight yourself into thinking it wasn\u2019t as bad of an experience compared to others! You can always talk this with your parents, siblings and friends you hold dear and I promise they will a 100% stand up for you. The next time you see him, let the people around him know what kind of scum he is, granted he might not get appropriate punishment but social death is a fitting punishment for such creeps.",
            "It's ok to be vulnerable. it's ok to cry get week but cry for not being able to attack them back, cry for people are around but not able to help or do anything for a girl walking on her way, so be brave enough next time that you don't have to cry for these thing. so, blaming yourself makes you week for next part so feel safe that you have your self to defence and attack back. Just think about how can I defence next time if this things will come back again prepare for it we are girl, lady, women now you can save yourself Nepal is one of the challenging place to blame ourself and be vulnerable for this thing stand strong stand for yourself everything will be fine\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I feel your pain sister, I was a victim of sexual assault in public too. My mind was frozen and I was in shock that time to even react.  As what others had written if the surrounding area has cctv. Then I suggest asking to see the footage, when and what time the incident occurred. I feel if he gets reported to the authorities, he will get a criminal record.    Stay strong sis, I know you are in alot of disbelief, pain and shock right now. All of us victims have to share our experiences and fight back for our rights.",
            "I'm sorry this happened to you.  In my definition, this wasn't mere harassment, but it was sexual assault.  I think it would be appropriate to scream.  Draw attention to what happened.  You did nothing wrong, let people know that you've been attacked.  By doing this, you protect yourself, but you also protect others, because this young man will likely be emboldened by his actions and do it again, and then worse.  Talk to your friends, talk to your family.  Get to know people in shops along the route you take to and from training.  If you feel unsafe, drop in and tell them so.  Again, you didn't deserve this.  Love yourself, and protect yourself.",

But if you don\u2019t report and complain\u2026then it will be hard for you. Still couldn\u2019t be deemed your fault even if you are scared to share, but if you don\u2019t report or share this with your trusted ones like your parents and family, they will not know and the help will be hard to reach you. \ud83e\udee1",

Yes, it was a harassment and that moron crossed the limit. Next time you see that person, I would say just attack - self defense is legal and appropriate.   I am sorry you have to phase this, however, everything happens for a reason. Perhaps you had to go through this incident and emotion cus you are meant for big. Perhaps this injustice to you will lead you to do something really big that will eradicate all the existing violences around the world.  Hold your head high and feel more prepared now. Feel all the pain you are feeling. Never forget that this has happened to you. Make this incident your fuel to fuel you up every-time you feel down. You are someone chose by the GOD because yes there are a lot more other cases that needs our attention (not to compare or diminish your incident). Thank you for sharing and being someone who can face such incident.   That person who did that to you, is never going forward. It was his last day. Even if he is alive physically, he died yesterday. He gonna be stagnant for the rest of his life. I know you would not even wish that to him but thats the karma he will be facing.  Sending you lots of strength and love.

K......... Mamu lai cancer bhako xa.\" I didn't cry at all. I was talking like it's nothing.  and while I write this in the bathroom sitting alone. I am sobbing in tears. She has always been inspiring. Lovely and would fight for anyone who would speak against me and I am here abroad writing this. Knowing I should be with her, helping her with chores and her health and I can't. I am steps aways from getting life sorted here ( abroad ) and with this news I don't know if I should leave everything behind me and go back to care for her.  She always used to tell about how she dreams of suffering from Cancer. Usually would say those stuff often.

        "selftext": "When I was a kid, we constantly had power outages from 5 pm to 7 or 8, you might not like my view on this, but it was one of the best memories I had growing up. After load shedding, everyone would get out of their houses and talk to each other. They would vent their frustration about how shitty the Nepal government is, this and that, etc. But it was really good community time. Nobody could do anything; no mom could force their children to study because there was no light. No electricity, no WiFi, no TV. We were cut off from every form of technology, and mobile phones back then were Nokia. Kids would play and catch fireflies and play hide and seek at night. And no light pollution, meaning you could see stars. I haven't seen stars in 4 years now in Kathmandu.  and the excitement when power came back and we all said bati ayooooooo",
        "comments": [
            "I remember memorizing the load shedding schedule by heart, good old times",
            "Unfortunate times, Later Cool Man Ghising exposed this nexus of deliberate loadshedding caused by corrupt men of NEA and powerful businessman involved in generator, inverter, energy business. The whole country was kept hostage by just a group of people. When this news broke out I really thought how naive and gullible Nepalese people are.     Here are some achievements by Cool Man Ghising:  1.\u00a0 Thanks to the efficient management of Kulman Ghising, there was no load-shedding in the Kathmandu Valley on the day of Laxmi Puja in October, 2016. This was a rare case before as there is huge power demand on this day of the Tihar festival.  2. In the months that followed, Ghising declared Kathmandu, Pokhara and Bharatpur loadshedding-free zones, one after another. He also declared Nepal as a load-shedding free country in April, 2018 by ensuring adequate supply of electricity to the industries as well.\u00a0  3. NEA\u2019s accumulated loss stood at Rs 34.60 billion in fiscal year 2015/16 (2072/73 BS). In his four-year term in office, Ghising not only reduced the loss to zero, but also turned it into a profit-making entity with an accumulated profit of Rs 4.86 billion.  4. The NEA was in loss of Rs 8.89 billion until fiscal year 2015/16 (2072/73 BS). But this public utility company has been transformed into a profit-making state-owned enterprise with an accumulated profit of Rs 11 billion.  5. Electricity leakage stood at more than one fourth of NEA\u2019s total power supply. Ghising had brought that down to 15.27 percent from 25.78 percent. (Year 2020)  6. \u00a0 In year 2020, Per capita electricity consumption had reached 250 units, up from 131 units recorded on year 2016.  7. \u00a0 Access to electricity increased by nearly one-fourth of the total households in the country in Ghising\u2019s four-year term. During 2016, only 62.16 percent of households in the country had access to electricity. That figure stands at 86.44 percent in 2020.  8. NEA imported 1.77 billion units of electricity from India in fiscal year 2015/16, spending Rs 13.12 billion.\u00a0 Four years later, the country imported only 1.72 billion units of the total 7.74 billion units of electricity consumed in the country.\u00a0  9. \u00a0 NEA could complete the construction of Chameliya Hydropower Project (15 MW), Upper Trishuli III A Hydropower Project (60 MW) and Kulekhani Reservoir-based Hydropower Project (14MW).  10. Until fiscal year 2015/16, hydroelectricity projects with the power generation of 801 MW were in operation across Nepal. But now, this has increased by 57 percent, taking the total power generation capacity of the country to 1257 MW. Dozens of power projects with a total capacity of around 3,000 MW are currently under-construction.\u00a0Year 2020.",

            "I'm working as a contractor (Jr. Software Engineer) with a US startup company, and honestly, they are paying me really well even though I work part-time. I can't help you with a job directly, but I can give you some suggestions on how to land one.  Building your public profile is incredibly important. People often think there's wild competition for tech jobs, but that's not entirely true. When people apply for jobs online, 70% of applicants lack basic skills\u2014they don't know fundamental stuff. Many can't work quickly enough, and companies have to fire them because they can't handle the pressure.  If you're someone who only has experience with basic to-do or eCommerce projects, or if you haven't worked with a large codebase, please start doing so. Check out open-source projects and get familiar with larger codebases. When you build a project, don't just build it for the sake of building; create a product that could generate passive income. Think of a problem you can solve, make it a paid solution, and work on it. Your project will be far more impressive than others.  Share your work online on LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms. Reach out to people and make connections. Message people on Twitter or LinkedIn asking for help\u2014don't worry if they say no. Just make sure you are skilled and the right person for the job.  I know these are very generic things that you may already know, but if you keep following this advice, it will surely help you.",

They reserve 2 fuckin bus and came to malekhu to fuck us up. They try to pin down one of my uncle who was responsible for beating down few baireni guys with rod. They chased him with knife and eventually caught him and stab him. He played dead and as whole city came to knew about it, we chased those baireni guys and burn down one of the bus they had reserved. Crazy days. Charri, radhe later came down in market after some years.

We live in the so-called capital city of the country, but it's hard to find a bus after 7 pm (6 pm in winter). We often hear about women being harassed on buses too. Even in this subreddit, there are frequent posts about this issue. Pickpocketing has increased significantly.    The main thing that I hate about public transport here is the crowd.Gundruk khocheko jasto kochan manche. Hami pani k garna sakchaum ra? Sab lai afno destination pugnu nei cha so khocherei bhae ni janchaum. Ajjha bihanei pack bus ma chadnu pare ta jhan mood nei kharab. Yeso kaile katei jum bhane ni bus ko travel socherei lyang lagcha.    Then there's the behavior of conductors. Some are good and well-behaved, but others seem to be waiting for an opportunity to loot you. Even when you show them your ID card or give them the exact fare, they argue, saying, \"Bhada badhisakyo\" \"Yati nei ho\" etc. You have to negotiate even when you're in the right. Yati kura ko lagi pani traffic lai complai garchu bhanera bhannu parcha ani balla manchan, koi ta tesma ni mandeinan.  Moreover, if you're new to Kathmandu or a tourist, they'll ask you for double fare. There was a post here by someone whose relative from Terai who was unaware of the fare was charged double.    I'm glad that we have services like Pathao and Indrive nowadays. Yes, they're not always affordable, but they've been very helpful, especially at night. Every time we hear mayors and ministers talk about improving public transport, but they never take any steps towards its improvement. Sometimes, I watch videos of public transport in Japan and European countries, and I'm amazed. Then I compare it with ours, and it's shit. I know we can't compare ourselves with them, but come on, decent public transport is a basic necessity in big cities.    The number of passengers and the number of available buses aren't balanced. On top of that, the public transport union is so strong that no one can hold them accountable. There's syndicate on some routes. There was an article by Ukaalo about how Nepal Yatayat has a monopoly on its route. Also, with the constant change of ministers, every time the transportation minister changes, progress stalls. I watched an interview with Chiri Babu Maharjan (LMC mayor), and he mentioned that each time a new transportation minister arrived, he discussed improvement plans with them. However, as soon as plans were made, the minister would be replaced. Most of them don't even provide any briefing or information to the new minister before leaving office. So, this cycle continues.  Yes, we have Sajha Yatayat with huge buses and everyone prefers them, which automatically makes it crowded. Sajha has introduced new electric vehicle (EV) buses, but they are very small.  For now, if we could just travel on a bus that isn't too crowded, that would be revolutionary. I am not even asking for metros and all. Just improving public buses would solve most of the problems.  This issue is long.",

            "TL;DR: Public transport in Kathmandu is frustratingly poor with limited buses after 7 pm, rampant harassment, pickpocketing, and overcrowding. Conductors often overcharge, especially tourists or newcomers. Despite promises, little is done to improve the situation. Pathao and Indrive are helpful alternatives but not always affordable. Strong public transport unions and frequent changes in ministers stall progress. Even minor improvements in bus services would be a significant relief. Credit chat gpt",
            "To further add to your point abt the syndicate, I experienced smth that was so fucking stupid. Happened in Pokhara, we were abt to return to Kathmandu, went to the hiace's stop for vehicles. We learn that the hiace samiti was protesting cuz a driver was arrested/taken in by the cops for charging extra on passengers midway. This happened a few months ago, and it's kinda crazy how these people have so much power over our law enforcement. They were deliberately hiding these vehicles and we finally got into one after finding out the hidden location, which was just 2 mins away in an open ground.   To improve our public transport, we need better regulations and law enforcements. We've got the buses but we need proper rules and regulations. Making a proper schedule for buses arrivals and departures, dedicated bus stops, example: One in Bijulibazar, the other in New Baneshwor (make people walk a lil, special exceptions being emergencies and disabilities). Also, no tolerance for overcrowding the bus with people. Idk the pay structure of bus staff but if they start getting a fixed salary rather than the salary determined from the volume of people, then the low volume of people shouldn't be a problem.",

            "The solutions seem simple but there is no political will. All the people who can do something just jump in their SUV and drive around.

            "Buses alone are not the problem. Economic disparity hernu parcha. Social construct ra status symbol hernu parcha.  Many hune-khane don't ride buses because they don't see people like them riding the bus. When this happens, a huge chunk of upper-middle and upper class people are excluded from the equation. This then reduces the need and purpose for bus operators to cater the demographic (response to someone commenting down below that you should operate 30 seater bus with 35 people) - is not going to happen. There is no demand for traveling luxuriously within the city. So bus operators do not allow the required route or timing for such buses.  Again, cars and bikes are luxury (how customs dept. of Nepal correctly defines them as bilasita ka bastu) instead of a daily necessity. Getting a car is to show relatives and colleagues rather than getting from point A to point B. A lot of people invest in expensive cars because that's what others see. Nobody is going to come and check your kitchen or your bank account - but everyone will definitely and certainly check your car.

I told her its not exactly fair that I pay the same when my room is half hers with no windows or even a door. She is very loud,listens to loud music,watches shows with full volume. But when I once listen to somewhat loud music,she yelled at me.   She is very rich and her family bought her a fridge,after this her behaviour is getting worse. She has problem with how I place vegetables in her fridge,with how I cook,what I cook. When its me who does most of the chores. Now her brothers are living with us and they treat me as a maid,I cook for them,do the dishes.  Other day, she was blaming me because her clothes got soaked in rain. When I didnt know she had washed her clothes and I was too busy in the kitchen.   I feel so helpless and I do want to speak up but I've been pushed over for all my life so its so hard for me to take my stand.

They have no need to send remittance, their grandparents are near death and their ancestral land will become empty.  They are the children of the wealthy and educated, hand picked by 1st world nations who recognise their value to society. The parents sell their life for an opportunity abroad so they can bring security for their children.  What is the plan then from here? Forget Nepal and focus on yourself? Should I cut off my roots, never receive an NRN card, assimilate myself into white society, create mixed Nepali children and through generations of this, completely remove any signs of Nepali heritage?",

People who think that just getting an engineering degree is enough to get a job are naive. Have you seen the competition? And people who will just get a degree or worse just clear high school, think that that's enough to land a high profile job are also naive. You also mean to say that the only successful people in Nepal are from rich and connected families and that there is no place for hardworking, enterprising people in this country? Get a higher degree, study harder and get better grades. Spend time improving your language skills. Get some other technical certifications as well. Work as an apprentice, if needed, for some months or even a year. If possible learn a foreign language. All that can be done for less than going to most foreign countries. You need patience and perseverance. Nepal is not doomed. If the Nepali youth give up and leave for other countries, then the youth from some other countries will come here and work. Life is what you make of it. There ARE people who NEED to go abroad to earn as their skill set is not enough.

I had a chat with my mom ( she being keen on the matter as a daughter of a Shaman and knows how it is believed to work) about this and she explained that when someone dies in extreme pain or regrets then the spirit of the person might become \u2018 Pret \u2018 'Pichaas\u2019 . Pret aatma wants to live near its clan but its nature is destructive and it demands attention and care to ease its pain. If ignored it will destroy the clan . So it needs to be tamed, contained and pleased for it to be of good nature and if done right,  it will turn from Pret to Bayu and protect the clan from harm. To be mindful Bayu is different than Kul devata which needs different discussion. So in order to Contain Bayu, the Shaman does rituals to tame the Pret aatma then it chooses a clan member and inters their body, it possesses and starts expressing its pain. By questioning it and finding things to make its pain numb , it is asked how much Khali it wants to eat to be satisfied . 'Khali Khanu\u2019 is the process of burning of piles of woods to hot red coals and the clan member choosen by pret dances on the coal until it turns into ashes, after which the caotic pret aatma becomes calmer Bayu .  So from the this perspective,  Your grandfather was a pret and now if already tamed, you have a Bayu in yours or one of your uncles house.

        "selftext": "So, I think the minimum wage in Nepal is around 17,300 something for newcomers in a 9-to-5 job according to the government. So, I went out with my resume to find a job, and when the time came for negotiation and I asked for the minimum wage because giving below it is a crime, I got weird stares and a few words from them saying nobody would pay that much anywhere. So, at the end of my job hunt, I found a place that paid around 15k, and it was so far I had to commute 4 hours a day by bus to get there, costing me around 3 to 4k per month. On top of that, I have to buy my own food and pay rent. At the end of the month, I am working for free. I was spending around 20k on a surviving room, costing 6k. Let's not add gas or rice, but lunch was around 4k per month. Bus fare was 120 per day, so 120 \\* 30 = 3600. I left the job after that. Man, I am paying to do a job. So, I decided to go to Japan for 5 years because I seriously tried to work for 6 months and I hated everything. My 6 months' savings got blown up on new shoes and pair of new cloths  .  P.S. In one of my interviews, the guy asking me question was Sisan Baniya. I was shocked too but he offered 12k so i left .  edit : i saw ads for job finder and some people gave me number for job broker  and that broker guy  said \"i will find you the job but you have to give me around 40% of my first 3 month salary  or pay the charge of 15k for fuking 12k job \"",

If your wants are eating into your savings, they aren't savings, they are expenses you aren't properly planning out for. Try revisiting your expenses outside of your needs, and cost-cut there.  I realize that it's impossible to account for everything when you are on minimum wage - esp when rent today can eat into your 50% income EASILY, so move into as a hostel tenant, or a paying guest, if you can't yet afford your own place: Living on your own introduces lots of scary and unexpected expenses esp with day-to-day living, that it makes sense to opt into it instead.  >commute 4 hours a day by bus to get there, costing me around 3 to 4k per month  Commutes are a time, energy, and savings killer.

            "Man idk why you're acting this bitter. A used cycle lasts a year easily with little to no upkeep - after a year they start to add up when you might wanna replace parts and maintain. Montly costings is just oil changing, brake tuning, and making sure the wear and tear doesn't get your cycle impacted in any way. You could acquire one like 8 months going by your own savings timeline. You'll save up on your 3k/month commuting if you opt to live closer within cycling distance after that, so the cycle essentially starts paying for itself.  You just see problems everywhere when you KNOW there's just no way to \"solve\" this without having more spending power, aka minimum wage(17.3k). 12k isn't minimum wage. It wasn't minimum wage in the last decade alone. All you can do is try harder and make do, aba aru k bhannu \"Sorry dude\" bahek maile?  I'm sorry you have a shitty situation rn, and there's nothing I can do to help with that.",
            "I would start by leaving hostel and living with roommate. No shame in sharing room when one is struggling. Most out of core kathmandu rooms cost about 4k a month. Share it with a person and it drops down to 2k a month. I don\u2019t recommend going more than 2 person sharing a single room though. From the 15k you are left with 13k now. For furnitures, see hamrobazar, there are cheap furnitures people wanna get rid of there all the time. For commute, kp\u2014-\u2018s idea of cycle commuting is not bad. If you don\u2019t want to cycle, try to look at extreme ends of bus routes that passes through your office area. For instance, if the office is on ratnapark area, then you can live near thankot, satungal area which is cheap and a single bus will take you there. For food, see if there are any pundits around the area, they will sell you cheap rice and lentils. You can buy dried beans and stuff for food. I hope you are not eating out with your earnings. But if you are, investing in a 100rs approx tiffin box should be the largest money saver for you. About clothes, make a daily driver and act like that is your uniform. The less you need to change clothes, the less your expense will go there. Thamel ma you will get plain tshirts of cotton mix fabric for 250rs. Buy 2 of same color, and use one jeans costing about 1000 to 1500.  Earnings uthauna garo huncha, I know. But you still got to make the best decisions from your available resources.

            "Find ones that don't pay 10-12k per month? Minimum wage of Nepal's 17.3k. If you're willing to settle with 10-12k, forget savings, you'll have a hard time even living paycheck to paycheck. Beats trying to argue with random strangers with BS any given day of the week.  No good sir, you be more realistic, and learn you need to fight for your livelihood. If it means making ends meet, there'll always be negotiations to be had. 50-30-20 can be done easily if you take a hostel at around 8k, use 4k as your wants + needs(commutes etc - I know budget's tight but you do what you need to do), and 3.3k for your savings - assuming you have 17.3k wages. Or you could even cost cut further if you can manage basic needs yourself better on around 12k expenses for room, board, cooking and laundry, then save whatever you can every month.  My first job was waiting tables for 8k a month full time, when minimum wage then was 15k - I paid my own college fees, stayed at my own place half starving, made it to my classes AND my work, around 2016. So I know what I'm talking about here, pal - and I know for certain unless it was scholarships and occasional tips, I'd prolly be dead off of malnutrition.   You just can't do the shit you wanna do in that income bracket. Either apply to more places and get hired somewhere that'll pay you a fair wage, or move back in with your parents/relatives.",
            "They start as low as 10k? Look for places a bit far away from schools/unis. Those are usually cheaper. You don't need one RIGHT next to the office you'll be working at, even if it means 10-20 mins of walking, you should be able to find at least one hostel that offer a triple room for 10k easily. That's the going rate anyway, for those that are in hostel associations(my friend runs one around Koteswor area)  Again, negotiation skills are needed here. You cant just go belly up and pay what's quoted to you: They'll obviously favor the Hostel owner. Reason you won't be there like students, nor will you be demanding of energy/water/laundry needs. Yk, try and be reasonable, it's difficult for hostel owners to fill their hostel 99% of the time, so they'll be willing to knock down the price if you can at least reason with them.  Lastly, stop panicking like this, and try your hardest to get a proper living wage of a job. If they're saying they'll pay you 12/14k only, then have the guts to tell them \"Sorry sir, ma part time gardina\". Go for jobs that are skilled, they have higher base pay than data entry positions: because employers know they're dime a dozen, and thus can afford getting away with underpaying them.",

Also, FYI, 8k mah majjaley hunxha hostels still. If you can muster up the energy to find it. Making concessions, arguing you're an office worker and not a student, which would mean less footprint to the hostel. Lie if you have to. But make them believe it's better value having you(since you said you have skills as an electrician, that's grounds you can negotiate on), than a random highschooler that's a PITA.  Negotiate like your life depends on it. Which it does, sadly. Nobody's going to go \"Ae baabu bichara lu aau 8k ma basa\". If you don't have the means to pay for it, entice them with ways you can be of value to them that makes them wanna keep you around.  >thanks for helping .  No need to thank me. Trying to be of help has been utterly unpleasant of an experience. Try not to take your frustrations out on a random person because personal circumstances are your own doing, and not someone else's.

Then the guy at my side just looked at me and was like \"I will pay your bus fare.\" Now my mind was still foggy from the sleep, the first time he talked I didn't even registered he talked to me.  He repeated that again and I said no but I was so confused and my sleepy state wasn't helping either. He just went off and before getting off on his bus stop he looked at me and was like \"I have given your bus fare already don't bother\". I again said no but now I am weirded out and sooo confused. My brain was not functioning. I finally checked my belongings and they were there exactly where they were. I literally don't know him and haven't even greeted him once in my life. Then I thought maybe he was just talking maybe he was drunk idk. But at my bus stop I tried to give my bus fare but he infact had given my bus fare. Someone please tell me what was this? Am I thinking too much or is it weird?   TL;DR - I dozed off on my bus ride back home and some stranger payed my bus fare.   ",

If there's momo on their menu, it's mostly frozen stuff being sold.  I used to work in a restaurant once and got contacted by those wholesalers. Apparently, it's a lot cheaper to buy frozen momo than make it yourself.  We had a guy from Ilam come to work in the restaurant and the first thing he complained about was why Kathmandu's momo has so much MSG and masala. He tried to make momo alone, but it wasn't profitable, so we switched to frozen momo like every other restaurant.  It wasn't just us selling frozen momo, but every franchise in Nepal was selling frozen momo. Turns out, you need a lot of people to make momo, at least to be profitable, and it's a mess.

        "selftext": "When I tell this story with my friend, some of them say, \"You are crazy\"or  \"maybe you are PAGAL\", but what I experienced is true.  In the year 2019, I was working as a waiter in a restaurant in the Jhapa district of Nepal; I was 19 years old at that time. There is a person named \"RK,\" who is the owner's son, and their VANJA is \"HK\"( i name them RK and HK to protect their identity). I had a really good bond with \"HK\" rather than with \"RK.\" Whenever I saw \"HK,\" I always felt he was a very nice person, and he always showed love towards me. I can't explain his love in a sentence; he is truly the nicest and kindest person I have ever met in my life.  In 2020, I left my job and returned home because of Covid-19. After 1 months, I heard from my village friends that they were saying, \"The owner's son of your workplace's restaurant, RK is dead in an accident. Did you know?\" Whatever they said, I didn't give a f\\*ck because I didn't believe it. It was the time of Covid and lockdown; it was almost impossible to believe such a thing people die in acceident.  After five 6 or 7 month , I was invited by another restaurant in the Jhapa district. When I went there to meet with the manager , I planned to visit my previous restaurant because my beloved \"HK\" was there. I went to the front of the restaurant, knowing that they were likely maintaining it. So, I went through the back gate. When I entered from the back, I saw \"HK\" with a smiling face. He welcomed me and showed me how they were maintaining the restaurant. He and I went to the top of the roof, and after a few minutes of conversation, I asked, \"Where is RK?\" He said, \"He is downstairs.\" I left him there and went downstairs alone. I saw RK; he was alive. The boys were just lying to me. After meeting with RK, I checked out from that restaurant.  Now, my destination was another restaurant for my work. I visited my new restaurant and started working there. After one month of working there, one of my friends who used to work with me at my previous restaurant came as a guest. I welcomed him, and after talking with him, he said, \"Did you know HK is dead in an accident?\" I was shocked by what he was telling me. I asked, \"When?\" He said, \"Oh, you don't know? I think it was about 7 months ago.\" I didn't believe him either because I had visited him just last month, although I didn't tell him that. But what surprised me was that the village friend also said that \"RK died in an accident,\" but he said that \"HK died in an accident.\" But the common thing was \"died in an accident.\" I didn't want to believe this either, but the phrase \"died in an accident\" was common to both accounts.  The next day, I visited that restaurant. There was a manager whom I had never seen before. I asked him, \"Where are those guys?\"  He pointed to RK, indicating he was there.  I asked, \"And the other one?\"  He replied, \"Another who?\"  I said, \"HK.\"  He said, \"He died in an accident about 8 months ago.\"  I was really shocked. I didn't believe him either. I started calling some friends who knew about him, but all of them said the same thing, \"He is dead in an accident.\"  Now, I still have a question: the person whom I met, was he just a figment of my imagination, a ghost or  is he alive ? I don't know help me to understand this. If anybody has experienced this kind of thing then let's discuss it..",

In this timeline, there is no such \"Padjero\" from Toyota but it's from Mitsubishi. Even the word \"D\" is removed from Padjero, now it's Pajero. That is one story.  The other is when I was 16 years old, I saw a movie and it was called Pulp Fiction, in that very movie there was a scene about Mr Wolf where he comes with his supercar with a license plate \"Mr Wolf\", now no such license plate exist, now the car license plate says something \"3ABM581\"  There are many more changes as well.

They can make some changes or make it happen so nepali people can have Visa with ease.   Protest is just a way in Nepal to get something. Because there isn't any legal way to handle events like this which can occur in future. So we don't see much protets in other countries about the laws and legal rights. They just do for good livelihood of their people.",
            "Absolutely agree with you. It's old nepali habit of protesting out of policies.  It's not the US Embassy's fault that Sandeep decided to misuse his US tourist visa to hide in Florida when evading Interpol arrest. US Embassy probably has a policy to ban entry to the country in such situations.  They wont just skirt such rules because sandeep throws good googlies. Unless they change the worldwide directions to US Embassies to not ban everyone who decide to hide in US to evade interpol, it isnt possible to give him visa.   People abide by the rules. One professor didnt even agree to take my homework 1 minute later than the deadline and gave me a 0 because his logic was if he takes my homework he has to amend his syllabus and change the time of submission to 12:01 for everyone."

        "selftext": "   Recently, I was talking with my cousins, and many of them were discussing their plans to move abroad. Some have already moved, some are in the process of applying, and others are planning to apply as soon as they finish college. This made me think about how dull various festivals and gatherings are going to be in the future. Even festivals like Dashain won't be as enjoyable anymore. I think many of us can relate to this as our close friends or cousins have moved abroad.  There was a time when we used to meet our cousins and have fun during various parties and functions, but now there are only a few of them left. You know those distant cousins that you only meet at someone's wedding or certain functions? Those events used to be the occasions where you would see them, but now even that seems unlikely. I'm not going to lie, I felt a little FOMO while listening to their plans. Not just cousins, even your close friends who you used to hang out with must be abroad now.  I'm not against the idea of moving out. At some point in life, everyone wants to pursue their dreams. We all want to improve our lives. That's how life is. However, hearing all these plans did make me feel a bit sad.",

Nothing beats the feeling that your parents are gone off putting tika with their relatives and you can stay at home and do whatever.  I enjoy these priceless moments of being able to ease off and relax during holidays. You don't get to do that on work days.",
            "Yeah sad part is even those abroad will miss the festivals but not by realizing that on Dashain/Tihar etc - its more so when realizing people around you are out celebrating their festivals and thats when you realize how it used to be back home/childhood days. But another aspect is once you grow up and have ones own family - I guess you would focus more on your kids rather than your own experiences idk",
            "That is the difference between being a kid and being an adult honestly. I live in abroad and have been celebrating festivals here for quite a few years now, the things we enjoy is very different than what we used to before. Also we are responsible for hosting so it totally depends on how we want to celebrate.  Everythings changes when time has come so there is no comparison.",

            "Life is never fair. But it doesn't mean you have to be unfair to you, and everyone that's involved in your life - rather, you should strive to be unconditionally fair to yourself, then everyone else around you. Keep your eyes out, and you'll notice that life often loves being unfair to your advantage as well, just like it equally loves being unfair to your detriment. It's how you perceive it, and how to tackle it: Your attitude towards life.  Why wander looking for happiness when it's been right there, within you? Need for more money, more responsibilities, more fame, more this, and that, these are just you adding problems to yourself for you to solve. I'm not saying stop trying to grow as a person, but don't forget the fact that society unfairly loves glorifying successful people. It doesn't matter if the successes were preceded by a mountain's worth of failures - it's just conveniently tucked away. And the average reptile brain looks at one success, isolated, robbed out of all of its context, and the story of struggle behind it, and thinks \"yeah, I want that\". Without taking in how long, or hard the success had to shed blood, sweat, and tears to get where they are today.

            "Bakery cafe, Khaja time ma deaf service staff haru xan. People have been loving this kind of concept, these places are usually busy.   Check out the Ishara cafe (it's in India) where even the manager and owner are trained to communicate in sign language with their deaf employees.  Designing training modules and communicating will be a challenge.",
            "Many popular restaurants like that in Kathmandu already. Bakery cafe in baneshwor has staff like that, sushi time in purano baneshwor also has deaf and mute staff, khaja time near islington also has staff with disabilities. These are the ones Ive been to and have frequented. Im sure there are many more where I havent been to as well, as this is not something new here.  If the food is good people will come regardless (sushi time is very good hai, before I ate here I used to hate sushi, but I found the sushi here to be delicious and the varieties are also nice). Dont be under the assumption that customers will keep coming (back) just to show 'support' for the staff. The average Nepali customer is not **that** charitable.  Ive never heard anyone say \"oh that restaurant actually has disabled staff members, lets not go there\".  If anything, I've seen people willing to give those restaurants a shot over all the others in the area after coming to know that they employ staff like those.   Everyone will respect you for employing disabled people in your restaurant. Your friend probably meant to say that the disabled beggars that roam around (more than half of which are actually not even disabled) are seen in a negative light. How can you even think that a disabled person, that too earning an honest work's pay will be seen in a negative light. Everyone will obviously commend them for it.",

And introvert me would rather go there to eat alone rather than any other place. Been going there since 2019 and still one of my favourite place to go.",

            "I wouldn't mind, in fact a restaurant in front of my house hires a mute guy. But I don't want the restaurant to push as if they only hired disabled people like some sort of a prestige virtue calling nose elongating job. I want the restaurants to hire disabled people because they applied for the job interview. Not because the restaurant wants to push an agenda by hiring all disabled in order to force you to support them to support the employees.  Only downside is that they may be accident prone as in one time the waiter got my order wrong but I didn't take it in a wrong way or badly. We got to correct the order quickly.",

            "Restaurants employing physically disabled people like deaf and mute have already been running in Nepal. I went to one a decade ago in Kathmandu. Intellectually disabled people might have a harder time working in a fast paced environment like restaurants but if you're willing to work out some system specialized for such employees then it might perform ok or even well but it all depends on how well you make it happen. I can say generally people here do not have any bigotry that will stop them from supporting such restaurants they might even support simply from a place of goodwill but I would assume people will stop going if the service is not satisfactory due to any unique challenges your cafe might face because of the unique idea.",

Can a blind waiter shoo away an incoming housefly? Can a person with down syndrome manage the dripping of his saliva?  I am all for helping anybody in distress and physically disabled are some of the distressed populace.  It is better to give them any enterprise suitable for their mental age and as per their interest. If they are good in food industry and can amply manage hygeine, I am all for it.",

            "Thought of something similar to this when starting my restaurant (acid attack victims). The thing that got me out of it was the fact that I wouldn\u2019t be able to control what type of people came to my place and once they\u2019re drunk, they could say hurtful things to the workers",

            "I have had that idea of employing mentally disadvantaged groups in mind for a long time. I have a cousin with similar issues, and we have been trying to figure out a way he could spend his life, make some money, earn some skills to have a better life but that has been quite a challenge to us.   My idea was not for a restaurant but at supermarkets. I do see great discussion in this thread, and as someone has already mentioned, don't make this \"disability\" factor a selling point for the restaurant. If you promote a restaurant with other USP and make this just a niche part of it, people will appreciate it at the back of their head.  Apart from a longer time to train them, I see that you might have to provide some sort of transport service to them to travel from/to their home every day. However, to your benefit you'll have less staff turnover which is a great cost saver in the longrun.  If you do intend to move ahead with this idea, I'd be happy to provide my input. Or, if you need an employee after you initiate this project, I have my cousin! Lemme know!",

Having a first hand experience of this, I can guarantee if that is the case for cafe or something like requiring constant human interaction then the venture wont be successful as majority if not all look down upon people with intellectual disabilities.   Might be different in other countries but not here in Nepal. Not at least for another 10-20 years at least.",

It is hard to find the right person and the right training and the right position. Hopefully, a cafe that highlights the abilities of neurodivergent individuals can help remove feelings of lack of safety. That\u2019s the goal. I truly thank you for your insight!",

I personally live in a society where this is normal and encouraged, however I would like to learn more about the viewpoints of the society in Nepal.",
            "Correct. Thanks for taking the time",
            "That\u2019s what I was hoping for, thanks",
            "Thanks for clarifying the viewpoint",
            "It would not be offensive, but it would be looked at in a very \"off\" way. Intellectually disabled folks are surprisingly rare and usually have parents or peers who take great care of them until they are much much older. The idea of letting them have a fair shot at being their own person are sadly, very few and far beyond.",
            "I edited it. Also if I may ask, are you not Nepali? If you are why do you not speak the language.",
            "If you walked into a cafe, and the person serving was intellectually disabled, would you order and sit down? Would you walk out? Would you be mad or confused? Truly, Thanks for your answers as I don\u2019t know where else to go to find out.  I understand you say it\u2019s \u201coff.\u201d I think that although some of these people have caretakers until old age, some of them , if not most, would like to participate in normal society as much as possible.  I\u2019m trying to find out what the obstacles would be",
            "I am not Nepali.",
            "It would be a new experience, for sure; most people would be kind and forgiving but would be very confused. I frequent Naanglo a lot, and I see the confusion of people coming for the first time, but they are usually very accepting of accommodations for disabilities, so I assume it would be the same. The challenge would be to get the human capital to actually run it imo.",
            "I would probably be irritated at the least first but maybe after realizing they have some issues I might even be more sympathetic. There is already Nanglos/ Bakery Cafe like others have mentioned and in the past definitely the employing of deaf people was a factor towards me visiting those places. As long as the foods good and they are able to do their jobs well, Id say there wouldn't be much stigma eventually at least frm my perspective",
            "Yes no problem. If they are tidy and can take my order I would be more than happy to visit such a place. Frequently if the food is good. Personally I wouldn't even mind if the restaurant had something on the menu that might help me communicate with them better.",
            "Why the interest in opening a restaurant here then?",
            "Sounds like it would be a great point of education and to show people what some of this population can achieve. Perhaps it would motivate some and give hope to others. Maybe it could be a great way to introduce this topic in Nepal. Thank you again for the replies.",
            "After being in Nepal after a few visits I noticed An under representation of intellectually disabled individuals in society. I met a man in Kathmandu who used to run a daycare for children with intellectual disabilities. I then began to work with him. There was not a lot of support back then or information for locals To understand what was happening. One time, we went to the public pool with the children to swim, and everyone was overall shocked. A man came up to me and asked me why do I bring the kids to the pool?! He had an angry tone.   Many years later, I still visit Nepal and I have experience in the restaurant industry. At this stage of my life I am interested in creating a project that combines several of my passions. Business, hospitality, and philanthropy.   Why Nepal? It is a lot cheaper than my home country. I\u2019m not trying to enrich myself from this project, but the goal is to become a self sustaining project. I have a full time remote job at the moment that is my primary income. I can do this job while being in Nepal and focusing on passion project.   Also, I love momo.",

The Jesuits and later Protestant missionaries saw Nepal as a region untouched by Christianity, presenting an opportunity for conversion and expansion of the faith.  now you may ask why are u even making this doesnt a person allowed to choose their own religion yes they can but they should not force other ppl to convert to it and u may what force? so imma tell u a sort story so a frnd of mine like he was a close frnd of mine told me this the parents were hindus so was he but in a accident his father died and after we finished his father all ritual the christian ppl near his house stated to visit his mother regularly which his mom hated this went on for few month and one day the passtor of that chruh came in their with his nun he staright up took her to the chruh force her to drink some water and what u say that baptize her and he forced her to read bible after that day the mother and son leaved her village sold all her property there and came in city which left the mom traumatize and my frnd started to hate christian from that day on. on lets say with him we went to many places where similar thing and we found more than 10 of them and we also found a christian group in a discord talking about rioting in some places converting ppl by force. and we found many hideous video.and they are also targetting \u00a0literally target tyo financially challenged gau ko manchhe haru to make the convert to christianity  https://preview.redd.it/pew1pxi7qw3d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8dbea69950ee3acba200ea6018cc093666ebde4  and now i want to hear ur views do u have many story related to it and is it affecting nepali culture  edit: rember its not a hate speech just telling irl incident",

These people are targeted by Christians and either pressured until they converted or brainwashed into thinking all your worries will be over after converting. Mostly father, pastors and them people are joke.  Ma hindu nepali ho and I've been around people from outside the country and lots of them were Christians it's totally different there.

            "Maile nepal social ma ni post garkeo thea would do the same here as well. And m just a mid level researcher. So sharing what I have found.  Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and everything has different sects or branches even within themselves. Not all the sects believe in the same incarnation or same interpretation of particular deities of their respective sect.   Similarly Christianity ma ni as per my research I have come across many such sects who sometimes go above and beyond to convert people into faith but in doing so uses methods that come out as underhanded methods which has been documented and caught. Such actions have categorized all the people who believe in jesus christ to be viewd with the same prespective. Not all Christians go around preaching and waiting around the corners of the house.   Regarding Christian hate and christinization ma chai. I would say. Few people chor vayo vandai ma we don't hate the entire human kind. If such logic is to be used. None of the so called religion of earth can defend this argument. So generally calling Christians as people's faith converter and all vanera hate speech garnu would not be a wise move. Christian haru ko presence le society destroy matra vako chaina improve ni vayeko cha. We cannot shed light on popular  happenings only and not see the entire result. I have witnessed many societies who got to save their family from falling apart, who got their loved ones healed and recovered from deathly illness, but the media doesn't talk abt those events. And what could gain more views in our country..?? Christian hate ofcourse so tei anusar ko reporter and medias ko influence le pani ho. Yo hate failiyeko. people however do not do research on those matters.  So there are definitely few sects in so called Christianity who have done things which has been shunned by the society. But that being said. We cannot blame the entire Christian population based on failures of few people. I see the lack of research here just as you have mentioned.  Currently I am researching Christan sects and their impacts. I am not completely positive not am i blindly negative. I believe in my studies and findings only. So I was able to share this view of mine. Thank you.",

But guys are still fighting for Nepal Hindu rastra hunu parxa.i mean really?? Is this really you guys want? Do you guys think our ancestors and freedom fighters really want our country to be only Hindus.       Prithivi Narayan Shah said we are different flowers in the same garden.

I can't believe people are still fighting for Nepal Hindu rastra hunai parxa what the hell you guys will achieve huh??? I watched videos of gaurav also known as get set fly and he said what do you guys think what do you guys prefer Nepal to be totally Hindu rastra or secular national? When I read the comments bruhh then I realised why Nepal is a country with the lowest IQ.So guys let's just stop fighting instead of that let's make this world a better place to live. If you really wanna debate first of all read the bible it is the most selling book for a reason don't just post random things that you found in some random sites and videos. Be mature guys. I wanna clear the misconceptions that we Christians do not pay anyone to be Christians just like you guys said there are some fakes but we don't do such things.

            "particularly regarding allegations of forced conversions and unethical practices by some individuals or groups within the Christian community.   It's important to approach these claims with caution and verify the information before drawing conclusions. While there may be isolated incidents of individuals or groups engaging in such practices, it's unfair to generalize and attribute these actions to the entire Christian community.  Regarding the story you shared about your friend's experience, if true, it's indeed troubling. No one should be forced or coerced into converting to a religion against their will. Respect for individual beliefs and freedom of religion are fundamental rights that should be protected.  Overall, it's essential to have open and respectful discussions about these topics, focusing on facts and understanding different perspectives to promote mutual respect and peaceful coexistence among different religious communities.",
            "I'm an Atheist and Christianity has done most damage to Humanity among all religions. But in case of Nepal it is positive for some extent to oppose negatives of Hinduism. I don't need religion but despite my personal view freedom of religion is still one of basic human right. Normal human does need to be able to practice their religion freely coming right after basic needs to most people.  Dalits for thousands of years despite being Hindu as that's what the society itself believed in were never treated as equals and not even allowed in Temples to practice their own religion. They've been Hindus since forever but their very own religion deprived them of practicing religion, so it's fked up to worship a cult who thinks you're inferior to them. Christianity in Nepal provided those marginalized people with chance to actually practice a religion like normal people do and also filled their basic needs like financial aid for food, clothing, shelter, education. They treated them as equals!!!  Now argument might be that Dalits could move to Buddhism too as it's more local and promotes not just religion but nationality too as it strengthens Buddha's connection to Nepal.. But thing is Buddhism despite being welcoming to everyone, never made attempt to include Dalits or reach out to them.  So in summary Christianity brought equality to Dalits who didn't get justice for millenniums from their own religion. Christianity also brought us ton of money as foreign aid  as donations, made quality of life better for their communities in Nepal.",

Also, why don't you keep the same judgmental energy for buddhist monasteries?

She isn't even some influential person, just another girl living in the city. One thing I have learned living near many Christians is that they are quick to donate to these types of organisations, and I'm guessing the donated money is used in situations that you are describing.  But tbh, even my Hindu and Muslim friends are quick to donate to charity. My (Hindu) best friend donates 10% of her paycheck to charities every month.

Fighting a war on a flat terrain is not that hard provided you have the resources and enough soldiers to replace your fallen troops and that strategy wasn't going to work in Nepal. So, they knew it was a bad idea and It was not because Nepal had nothing to offer. Nepal held the direct passage to Tibet which was important for them to trade with China and it was not only important for the British but also important for other Indian states. It's just when they got what they sought for they just used their brains and settled with it.  Nowadays it's said like as if \"the grapes were sour\" but that's not the real reason\" lol.

I was traveling with my parents, bus was fully packed, then one middle aged man called me to sit in his seat. Later on, he pulled me and kept me on the lap and started touching my vagaina. ( tyo manchele euta haat le tesko bag samayo ani arko hand bag ko bich ma rakhera mero pant ko chain kholera he started touching me badly.)

He told `ma aajhai k k mitho mitho khane kura kindinchu tara timile maile bhaneko mannu parcha\u2019 and took me to uncrowded place and told me to suck his d***. One sister saw that and scolded him and dropped me home. I was around 7 years old when this happened.  3rd harassment happened to me when I was around 8 years old. Euta chineko budoo thiyo mamu baba sab le chiniseko, ek din he took me at his home ani he showed us( me and my friend) pornography videos and raped us. After a month, his son took me at his room and told me to suck his d***. I shouted and ran away.

I do not know how you will overcome it, for I have had the privilege of being born a man in this part of the world hence I do not know the hardships of a woman. But I do suggest letting it all out, either to a friend or maybe a therapist...it is better than keeping it all inside you.",

            "From one survivor of childhood trauma to another, I'm sending you good energy and positive thoughts.   For me, it's been quite the journey of healing which seems never to be complete. It has been filled with isolation, loneliness, and a tangled web of self-hatred and helplessness. However, I've found comfort in showing myself compassion, building a supportive network around my friends and loved ones, seeking therapy, and exploring various resources for healing with the childhood trauma. Mostly, understanding how it was never my fault and I should not be guilty and ashamed. It comes in waves the affirmation and rejection.   Everyday is level one.   Someday, I do have a cheat sheet to go through but most days, I take it one breath at a time. It does help.

However, not going to lie it is a struggle. It really does fuck you up but you have a choice to fucking it back in its ass. Do it with all the passion and power.   You my dear, are the only one who have the power to let it define you. Don't let it ruin your whole life on this platform.    And thank you for sharing. It was hard to read but I know it must have been harder to draft and hit the post button. Bravo! This is one of the step in the healing process. You're already taking strides to address your trauma. I highly recommend reading \"The Body Keeps the Score.\" While the exercises may be challenging at first recommend in the book. Please take them at your own pace. There is no hurry.   Also please remember that this journey belongs to you as much as your body does. Your home may have been trespassed, but it's still yours to reclaim and nurture. Trust yourself to redraw your boundaries.   I also want you to understand that what is working for me might not work for you or any of the resources that you seek, but know this- YOU'RE NOT ALONE.  Many of us share similar struggles and realities. In your darkest moments, hold onto this that you're not alone.",

            "I\u2019ve had similar experiences with sexual harassments from relatives and in public vehicles. The last one was when I was in Class 12 and this is surely because I left abroad after +2. I never thought much about those harassments, but when I started making new friends I noticed I hated it when people came near me, I didn\u2019t even let then hug me in a friendly way until I trusted them and deemed them safe which took years by the way. So at the age of 22, when my anxiety started spiralling and I started getting depressed, I went to a therapist and that was when I knew I was still living in my childhood and teenage years. After few years of therapy and talking to friends about it, I spoke about these with my family few months ago. Because I was still angry. I couldn\u2019t let go. I never fought back when those happened so now I wanted my family to know. This was my way of fighting. Above all, I started feeling better because I started acknowledging and understanding my own traumas.  Saying that, everyone has their own way of coping with traumas. Getting a therapist helps. I always thought therapists were useless but they\u2019re professionals for a reason. Later it also made me feel better when I spoke about these to my close friends, who were angry on my behalf and this meant a lot, I shared everything with my younger brother who took everything so well and now he asks a stranger if they\u2019re okay when they look uncomfortable in public places, I now tell people if they\u2019re on my personal space and they\u2019ve always understood. I now try and speak up. When I went to Nepal few months ago, I avoided the pubic vehicles. I still panic if people stand behind me, I still pretend like I\u2019m tying my laces and let the people walking behind me walk past me after dark, I still place my headphones on a minimum volume if I\u2019m walking alone in dark. I\u2019m still scared. But I\u2019m finally forgiving and moving on. The visions that were so clear have now started getting a little hazy. I\u2019m now 25, not 15 anymore, and I try to remind this to myself everyday.",

        "selftext": "Everywhere I go, there are Indian tourists.  Stopped in Mugling, the place was packed with them that I felt like I was in India. The Indians were yelling and talking loudly making a commotion and they stared at me as if I was a foreigner in there. They are coming in swarms in small buses, big buses, private cars. Old ladies, kids, young people.  One big group of them sat in a big circle on the pavement in front of the restaurant and ate in the floor. I dont' know if they are eating their own food or what.  The Nepali shop owners did not even have Nepali money to give change to me as he only had Indian money.  Why are so many of them here. Is it to escape the heat or is there something special this year?",
        "comments": [
            "The comment is making it seem that every indian coming to Nepal is coming in bus loaded like animals, with all fuel, food, everything.  This is far from reality.  You simply are noticing these bus guys more because of the volume, they come fully loaded in a bus, they gather in a place, they make their food even on road. Hence it gets more attention and you suddenly feel like these bus guys are everywhere.  These bus guys majorly come Pokhara to visit or the religious place to visit, they don't stay much and they leave. I don't see not spending money as a problem, they creating nuisance and littering is the problem, for which the government is there to make rules and enforce. Government is not capable of enforcing rules related to pollution on its own population, I don't know how they will enforce them on people of different country, OR may be creating a tourist police of some sorts lol.  Live in a border area for a day and you will find 100s of Indian cars coming in and going out of Nepal, These people stay in hotels, spend their money, some stays in normal hotels, and some in 5 stars.  And the people coming from Airplanes. These also do stay in hotels, spend money.  You will see rise of Indian tourist normally during Summer season to beat the heat more , compared to other season.  You mentioned the Nepali shop owner even didn't had Nepali rupees to give to you so that means they definitely are spending money.",
            "Their behavior regarding waste disposal really makes me mad.   But people are allowed to travel being frugal. Everything isn't  and shouldn't be about the economy. Poor people and the middle class do have the right to travel around. I am sure if I went to Paris with my bank balance, I would be the one locals would be mad at.   And the commotion is a rural culture prevalent everywhere and established due to houses being far from each other.",
            "What a amazing comment section this is good keep cooking op",
            "India is Nepal's closest neighbor, and travel between the two countries is very easy. There are good air and land connections, and Indians don't even need visas to enter Nepal. The heat might be a factor for some tourists, but Nepal's cooler mountain regions are a bigger draw for escaping the summer heat. There isn't necessarily anything special happening in Nepal this year that would cause a surge in Indian tourists. The reasons mentioned above are likely the main factors.",
            "It would be one thing if these so called tourists spent their money in Nepal. A lot of them bring their own gas, chulo and cook food they brought. Sleep in the bus or outside the bus and don\u2019t spend a single paisa here. Just dirty up the place and leave. Wish the govt. found a way to manage these so called tourists.",
            "what i hate is they don't follow rules and treat our country like it's theirs. Most indians coming to visit nepal are mainly devotees coming in groups, i don't think that they are even increasing our tourism sector by any chance. Mula haru auxan paisa kharcha grnuparey ni gardainan, ani garey pani  koi koi ta ajhai pasaley sanga kich kich garxan.

Something should be done about these types of tourists..",
            "I saw one indian on his phone talking inside pashupatinath and another one had his gopro out while it is clearly prohibited to use phone inside the temple. The one with gopro even got mad when the police there told him to keep it inside his bag.",
            "I believe couple years back. Some indian died of gas poisioning.   Do not save so much that will hurt you in the end.",
            "They come in their buses, filled with fuel in their country, foods in tiffin boxes, sleep on buses always, washup and clean up in rivers and lakes and return without spending a single penny.    All we get is pollution,good trade.",
            "Few years back there was no Indian tourist but cheapskate Chinese ones, which is currently replaced by Indian tourists. There must be a trend among travel agencies to explore major Nepali religious places in a relative cheaper price which in results attracts people from rural areas.  I don't mind tourist of any economic tier from any place of world but tourist should always respect the values and environment of the foreign Nation.",

            "The latest report in Tourism Ministry's site is of 2021.   Indian tourists constituted 43% of the total tourists we had in 2021, numbering around 65k.   The total tourists were also categorized in 7 groups, based on purpose of visit- Holiday Pleasure, Trekking & Mountaineering, Business, Pilgrimage, Official, Conv./ Conf., and Others.   The total no. of tourists recorded to have come for Pilgrimage was 11,172. Even if we were to assume every single one of those pilgrim tourists were Indians only, that leaves around 54k Indians for other categories (that are arguably less suited to skimp on expenditures).   That leaves a big chunk of GDP from tourism on Indian tourists. We only see the motherfuckers doing laundry on lakeside, and cooking in front of restaurants because that's where we broke people are too lmao.

Pashupatinath temple makes millions from these poor people donating.   When white people do it, its camping, when Indians do it its homelessness. Let them travel in budget whats your problem.  Just say you hate Indians. No need to rationalize hate with any specific reasons.",

So you really believe it is possible to come from India, through the hilly terrains of Muglin and reach Kathmandu,  stay for a few days and go back without spending a single penny in fuel, shelter and transportation? Then you ate deluded and prejudiced. Maybe they are more economical than the other tourists but that's the free market, isn't it? Businesses find new avenues to attract people to spend their money, and people try their best to spend as low as possible. If they find that staying comfortably in our hotels is not worth spending the money and they would rather sleep in their buses, then we probably need to lower our prices?",
            "If I see any of that shit happening in a public place, I\u2019m confronting them. I don\u2019t care if they are Nepali or Indian or any nationality. Some people around there work hard to keep that place clean and these idiots just ruin the fun for everyone.",
            "Naw indian people bring everything they need while visiting nepal. They bring their own food, gas, chulo sab and cook and eat outside rather than on hotel to save cost. They create so much waste while they spend very less on our country, so i dont its a good news either.",

There are few people who does that who especially belong to medium class family and mainly to escape from heat wave just as OP said. They are also a human. If the weather would have been good, probably they wouldn't worry about travelling and would be busy in their own lifestyle. Indian are mostly around the world based on their ability to spend money during the summer. High class people are mostly visiting to the expensive places and vice versa.

They hang their clothes in the metal bar and that place looks very unpleasant.",
            "The Indian bus tourists are here mostly to visit two places, Pashupatinath and Pokhara. Don't you think a visit of 1-2 days is enough to get to those places from the border?    And not only they bring foods in tiffin, they also bring uncooked foods, gas and some utensils too. I have travelled around highways and Pashupatinath to see them with my own eyes.   Talking about Tourist buses, they normally have around 200-300l tanks with 15-20 km mileage let's say it's only 10, giving them 2000-3000km worth in full tank, birgunj to Kathmandu is 150km, biratnagar is 350, Kathmandu to Pokhara is 200 km, I think you can calculate how much of petrol may be used in round trips from-to any of above or other border.

The pashupati area (near tilganga....near that orange bars and stuff) is total shit because of them.",
            "And FYI tourist buses don't give a mileage of 10. Even small 800cc cars like Maruti gives a mileage of 10-15. I think 3kmpl is a good average in these hilly roads, and you claim they come jam packed and even loaded with vegetables from India. Just comical.  Probably they buy their materials in Nepal",
            "That's their right. You cannot force anyone to do anything.  I don't think that is a majority of tourists.   Okay, ignoring all this, what is your option? Ban them from sleeping in the buses? Ban them for entering the nation? There's nothing you can do if they are smart enough to travel without spending a single penny. Maybe I need to learn something from them haha",

I would agree with you if you said the same thing for Nepali tourist on Indian, i don\u2019t give a shit who you are, just don\u2019t trash where you are coming as a guest.",

            "Thats why thats cheap toursit. If you cannot help local business, you just another person not helping to build economy. Dont spend all but spend at least sth to help the local business",
            "You are taking examples to the extreme. No way tourist buses give 10kmpl man. Maruti Suzuki, 800c, gives 15 in the hilly roads with many turns. Maybe in a freeway (which there are 0 in Nepal)  but no way they give 10kmpl in Nepali roads. Maybe you need to do more research?  And also how do they carry food for that many passengers in that low of a space? Even for a small school picnic our school had to bring one additional bus for food and cooking equipments. There's no way they can do all that and visit even just KTM and Pokhara in 2 days. Let's say they are from Gorakhpur. It takes a day to reach KTM without all the stopping for food. If they stop to cook food and then clean up and pack everything back in the bus for each meal, Let's say 2 days to reach KTM. 1 day to visit. One day to reach PKR. One day to explore PKR and Let's say 1 day to come back. Easily adds up to a week at max. It's not logistically possible at all. Maybe they cook certain meals just because of diet restrictions but that's not even economical to do. The extra petrol it consumes and extra gas it consumes amd extra time it takes isnt worth the price. Maybe in an extreme case, if they are coming for pilgrimage and do not eat outside food for religious reason, they can do that. But I don't really think it is that common of an occurance and not financially consistent with saving money. The only scenario I can think of is they don't eat garlic onion potatoes etc and they are here to visit religious places to wash away their sins. Those religious fanatics are just a collateral damage of having more tourism",

Leaving the petty semantic argument - it would be good to have a lot of tourists who spend outrageous amount of dollars but given the economy that is impossible.    Most people who are tourists are normal people who want to make the most out of their money so let's try not to be dicks to those people.",
            "Lol. I am as much of a Nepali as anyone but I am also not dumb. I am speaking from experience. There is a town in Sankhuwasabha called Khandbari whose hotels completely rely on Indians working at the Arun Third hydropower project. I know how big of a role they play for the local economy in places like this. How do I know this? I live there.",

It definitely will be better if you start working on your own being able to pay for whatever you want without any guilt. So my suggestion study well, work hard on yourself, improve yourself and try to find a job even if you don\u2019t internships might be great for experience.

Six months ago, I thought I\u2019d switch the businesses over to a web-based telephone host to route calls more effectively (SIP-based). This technology is available in both countries.  In the US, I signed onto a website, filled out a form, entered my credit card, and agreed to pay $5 per month. I had the system up and running in an hour.  In Nepal, the monthly price was ten times as much and required a massive deposit. That wasn\u2019t even the worst part. I was told by NTC that I needed letters of recommendation from three different ministries to purchase the service, and my request would be reviewed over a series of months. They would come inspect my office and ensure that my request was \u201cgenuine\u201d. When I asked what that meant, the officer didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve spent six months trying to sort this out, and I\u2019ve made almost zero progress. All this to buy a commercial phone line.  In the US, I spend about 1% of my time dealing with legal matters. If I have a question about regulations, I can Google it and have an answer. In Nepal, it\u2019s more like 30%. if I have a question, I usually end up spending a full day in a government office somewhere. Even then, I often won\u2019t get a clear reply.

        "title": "5 lakh rupees withdrawn/hacked via connectIPS. How did the hackers get the mobile phone OTP? ",
        "selftext": "# Edit: OTPs were sent to both mobile phone/SMS and email.   ***TL;DR***: *Money withdrawn illegally and unknowingly via connectIPS account. How did the hacker/s get the OTP codes sent to the mobile phone?*  Okay someone I know just had a meltdown a couple hours back this evening. Lets call them Raj. He has a Windows 10 laptop and an uptodate Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra or something.  **Raj downloaded a sketchy executable batch file** kinda thing from somewhere, the link being sent by someone on facebook under the guise of \"Data Entry Software\". Raj was told to run that file, and that they'd send another software for the actual work. Raj was looking for a job on the side to help with family expenses, etc. He is a devout hard worker and a lovely soul, but he deserved much more than what his job currently offered financially.  This was 1 week back. Today, **Raj's phone lights up with notifications for login attempts to their rarely used connectIPS account**, as if someone were trying to go through the \"forgot password\" route. He had his Laxmi Bank account linked to his connectIPS one. And then he **gets a lot of OTPs** for transaction. Lo and behold, the **money is all gone** from his Laxmi Bank account!  He asks for my help. I login to his connectIPS. Doesnt seem to show main balance/loaded funds anywhere at first glance, the interface is as unintuitive as it can get. Anyhoo, I find the **transactions history - there were 9 made during the past hour**. One 1 lakh transfer to a bank account and the remaining 8 to 2 Khalti wallets in batches, 50k at a time, 2 lakh into each. Total - Rs 5,00,000.  **We have the names and the numbers of the recipient accounts.** But they might not be the real culprits, the hacker/s might be just bouncing off those acounts to muddle their tracks.  He says that he hadn't logged in to his bank or connectIPS account since he ran the shady trojan batch file. He also said that the connectIPS password wasn't saved in Chrome when he tried logging in to check what the hell was up. He also wonders if his connectIPS password was reset by the hacker/s, since he either didnt remember the password, or what he remembered no longer worked -- his last use of the platform was so long ago that he doesn't exactly know.  Now I can understand what all could be done if some hacker got such direct access to your Windows computer, but what puzzles me is how they got access to the OTPs sent to his mobile phone!  **Could it be that the suspect windows batch file scanned the local WiFi for other devices and injected code into the android phone completely invisibly, without any user input?** Or is the central OTP sending server or their crypto/hashing compromised, in that one could generate OTPs at his/her will (like keygens for pirated software)?  Also, I'm not sure, but does connectIPS also concurrently send OTPs to email ID? (which could have been compromised since the hacker/s had full access to Raj's laptop)  I'm sorta the tech savvy one in our circle, but this is perplexing to me quite a bit. I know its all technically possible to be hacked and defrauded this way -- anyone watching enough movies/tv shows would... but how exactly did they get the OTPs.  **And what should Raj do in this case?** He already asked Laxmi bank to block his mobile/internet banking. He called up connectIPS guys (interesting that even a sorta government affiliated agency would respond at such hours), one of them forwarded his issue around to many via email. And he has contacted Nepal Police cyber crime division, who have asked him to file a report/send letter/email and some evidence (ex. transaction history).",
        "comments": [
            "TBH, when connectIPS disabled sending OTP via email , I was very pissed because that is only way the people like us in foreign countries can use connectIPS.  After lot of email and bad reviews in Google... they enabled it. But they have made it pain in ass  each time. They will ask random 3 questions.  I know you feel like CONNECTIPS is somewhere to be blamed, but trust me, your friend was victim of target attack. Since connectIPS does only transfer funds within nepal, police can easily trace money.  Collect all evidence and go to police.  If you have some Jack use it.",
            "Most likely scenario is that bat file redirected googles login page to a fake one controlled by the attacker prompting him to confirm that it's him. [ Edit : if no new logins were shown they probably used specialized browsers to copy every digital footprint from the .bat info stealer. I remember genesis market being popular for having their own browser to do such before eventually being shutdown by the fbi]  Since you mentioned he got bombarded with OTPs on his phone,maybe the post request for validating the code does not have rate limiting. Going through all 1 million otp code combination sounds doable with a good enough CPU.",
            "5 lakh is a big price to pay for downloading a virus from the internet.  I hope Raj has learned his lesson.",
            "can you share the contents of batch file that Raj executed?",
            "Yep, I agree that there should be options for OTP via phone/SMS and email, both. But they should be easily accessible. The interface, OMG, is so confusing for the average Joe/Jane they'd never use it.   He does not live in the valley rn, but intends to go there tomorrow to get it sorted. He is a government employee and has family in bureaucracy with contacts, so I think/hope it'll turn out well for him. That money is many years of saving for him, so it matters a lot.",
            "I can confirm that connectIPS did in fact send the OTPs to his gmail. He forwarded one of those OTP emails to me just now.   I still think thats a solid route the hacker/s could take. Might've accessed/logged in to gmail via Raj's Windows laptop itself for all I know. Like tunneled via or spoofed his laptop/IP address, bouncing off gmail/google requests via Raj's laptop.   He does say his device notifies him of google/gmail logins for new/unknown locations/devices though... and that did not happen in this case.",
            "This and mostly likely gmail sessions hijacked through the pc. I think that's the whole case here.",
            "Hey thanks for the response! Some of your jargon is a bit technical for me... but I can confirm that he got OTP codes for exactly the amount of transcations (9) that went ahead and emptied his bank account (via connectIPS). That is leaving out the codes he got before those, for attempts at login (via the \"forgot password\" option or sth, we don't know).  It does seem the OTP codes are only numeric (he sent me one when I had to login and look into what was up with his connectIPS), but I doubt they were brute forcing it. All of this happened relatively fast. Got through 9 OTP codes in 30 minutes or less. No re-attempts apparent, from their side. They got it right every single time (pretty sure there's multiple attempt/DDOS-kinda blocks in place even in the most crude Nepali digital finance/banking tools).  Edit: The OTPs were going to both, via SMS to his mobile phone and his gmail account.",
            "Sooner the better. Also contact bank .. hope this ends in good ways.",
            "Looking at it again and dumbing it down a bit I'm sure the  malicious file sent over all the information needed to replicate his exact browser that had he had logged in with his Gmail . As far as I'm aware , for Gmail as long as it's an IP somewhat near you and it passes all the info checks that got stolen it logs you in directly. Alot of info stealers work this way.  You will be surprised how careless people who design such things are. And to clear up the re attempt thingy, you wouldn't get a sms or email regarding that. They only need to send one otp and they can make thousands of requests to validate it if there's no rate limit. Either this or there exists a critical vulnerability in connectIPS.  The money is probably already laundered by money mules and converted to crypto through platforms like binance or paxful. If I were him I wouldn't expect to see my money back. This is the first time I've seen info stealers targeting nepali folks. Gonna take a look at it when I get some free time surely.",

        "selftext": "First of all, those of you who were too young to remember or weren\u2019t born at that time, let me tell you how powerful Kantipur and Kailash Sirohiya are. Can you believe Kantipur was one of the biggest catalysts behind 2062/63 movement? During that period, news channels(NTV, Image, and Kantipur) and newspapers were only sources of information. So they had huge influence over mass thinking and beliefs unlike today where Social media and individual journalism have helped balance public pattern of news consumption.   Kantipur was the biggest news media which is why they obviously had the power to drive agenda and they did so. By publishing articles against King Gyanendra and preparing news against his government, they backed political parties to gang up against King Gyanendra\u2019s government. I\u2019m not making this monarchy vs republic debate so let\u2019s not discuss more on that.  But that fact is Kantipur definitely does drive agendas not sure if they are of their own or of a third party hiding behind. Why are their columnists have been the same old 3-4 faces for the past 20 years? Doesn\u2019t Nepal have other intellectuals? Also, if you closely follow through, you will notice they purposefully ignore news no matter how big they are if they align against their corporate agendas. Likewise, their bias reporting and continuous attack on people with the intent of character assassination have to be closely analysed as well.   Moreover, most of these journalists and publications are driving agendas and therefore, it is necessary to neutralise their monopoly(which is already happening). As for Rabi Lamichhane, he surely has given ample rooms for his \u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927\u0940s to step in and attack him. I think don\u2019t see RSP as a political party as they don\u2019t seem to be working as a party. I think old parties are too damn of dirty workers to trust anyway. We still need an alternative force with a strong leadership. Right now, Rabi is leading that force. But with him trapped in all these allegations, Balen or someone else could replace him in case of him failing to navigate through all of that.    ",

            "Kailash siroya is not a nepali resident.  Nepal must deport him to his country.  Kailash siroya and kantipur are the agent to America and india. They leaked all the sources to them. There is a key role of Kailash and kantipur for the backward of the country's progress.",
            "You are absolutely right in your observation. I remember those days. Kantipur has manipulated the public agenda. Time for their downfall.",
            "Is r/Nepal getting retarded by the day???? You'd face Jail or get killed if you were adversarial to Monarchy back then. We WANT Jounalist to be ADVERSARIAL to politician. Freedom of press/speech and all that.   Back in his \"TV journlist\" days, did Ravi lamichane get famous by being \"nice\" to petty hakims/sarkari workers???   Dumb people are frightened easily so they seek safety in authoritariaism. Don't be dumb.",
            "Pls don't be genocidal. Don't write without facts. While I don't support him and am least bothered about what happens to a business group and its head, what hurts me the most is Nepalis peddling lies and racism.  Kailash Shirohiya is as much Nepali as you and me. He is born, educated and brought up in Madhesh Pradhesh. His father Ghasiram came to Nepal 100 years ago similar to how Bahun, Chhetris of today came from Rajasthan and other areas around 3 to 400 years ago. His father was chairman of Janakpur Chamber of commerce and was close to Koirala family. Ghasiram was not born in Nepal. So he has rightly taken angikrit citizenship. Kailash was born in Nepal. He has no other country to go. Just because he is from Madhesh, you cannot be racist towards him. Which country will be go? Will India give him citizenship??  Also you are ignorent about India. How you see Biharis, in the same way Rajasthani and Gujrati see Biharis. When Nepalis say Indians, they mostly have UP or Biharis in mind. But if Sirohiya goes to India, from which state he will take citizenship?",
            "\u201cRetarded\u201d is a strong word. Freedom of press is very important and Kantipur can report any news it likes. But what OP is trying to say about is the way they report their news. Completely targeted towards character assassination and aimed to generate hate towards the person in question. You know that they are trying to persuade the average news reader to be on their side and to protect their wrongdoings at all cost. What they are doing might be legal but we as a people should be aware of the motive of such media.  And also, they don\u2019t make news about their crime allies and the corrupt officials that have been in the political game for decades. They target the up and coming politicians or the ones in the opposition.",
            "You are missing my point entirely. Decent journalism is all we need and seek. I\u2019m just mentioning how Kantipur deliberately practices Character assassination. As for Rabi, he could be found guilty with proper investigation. It\u2019s not about taking sides. Stop assuming you\u2019re the only sane and smart one around while rest of the Nepal is dumb.",
            "You seem obfuscated by the veil of ignorance. Maybe a kangressi jhole. There was total freedom at that time - Kantipur exploited it fully. Stop this nonsense.",

            "whats the benchmark for decent besides your \"feeling\"? :They break stories, do investigaive reporting, is reputed enough to be quoted by all international media..  Rabi will throw KMG head in jail for bad articles. you think he will allow  \"proper investigation\" .If it was Arju deuba instead doing the same after the Refugee kanda, would you have championed her as well? I want journalist to do more \"charater assaination\" (aka. reporting on politicans I like), its their job and moreover, it their RIGHT.

I've reddit posts on Sirohiya's not paying their worker and calling out slimy Gagan Thapa for being the embassay's contact guy and his \"harvard scholarship\"long before Ravi-Jholey pretended to care about either of these issue.    Freedom of press is binary, you support freedom of press for all publication or you don't. you can't pick and choose.   If Ravi had the balls, he could have taken the kantipur to libel court for the \"character assination\". instead, he exploited his positon of power to settle personal vendetta.",

The thing is that he used to have blood pressure in the range of 150 mmhg. We used to advise him to take hypertensive medications but he used to say that he will control it by doing exercise only. He never listened to us So, I just wanted to inform you guys to keep checking your blood pressure and your family members. If you have high blood pressure then you should start medication with proper counselling from the doctor. All the best guys and take care of your health. Don't be careless with your health.",

I thought it was the same for everyone. Took me a couple years to realize what I had was much worse than a normal variation.   Since cutting out gluten, I've been 99.99% symptom free! Sometimes you just can't avoid it as people use wheat flour for thickening gravies/sauces or marinating/layering for fried stuff, etc.   It's quite a difficult thing to do - hardly any snack options remain, and you miss the food...

Because if dairy is your sole trigger, you shouldn't be having really bad reflux you're avoiding your trigger.   PS: when the connection between lower esophagus and stomach, via the lower esophageal sphincter (valve-ish functioning part) is too loose, it causes reflux no matter what.

In second meet, he will explain about Rich dad poor dad\u2019s 4 Quadrant(ESBI) the person will ask you for the summary next day about ESBI quadrant. Now you are in second round selection process. At 2nd round  they will send Bill Quain podcast \u201cAsk yourself this question do you own your life or are you just renting\u201d and they will ask you for summary.

You guess it right, summary is mandatory. After all these he will talk about business. Basically the business is about, i have to buy product from Amway and i will have to find other customers for buying their product. Its a mixture of both pyramid scheme and MLM.    Last month i was in their seminar as a guest. Standard maintain garna full formal dress hunuparxa. Praya jaso sub- continent ko matra manxe thiye tesma ni Nepali haru absolute majority thiyo. Euta ni blonde manxe thiyena tyo seminar ma.

I have done my own research about this so called business, its absolutely Ponzi Scheme. I have not lost a single money in this wretched business. Literally tapai haru jaslai afnu vandai hunuhunxa tyo manxe le tapai lai thagi ra xa.

It\u2019s crazy how people still fall for this. The funny thing is they try to defend themselves by giving the craziest reasons.  Hope nobody falls for this nonsense.",

            "I fell for this back in 2017-2018 and ended up paying around AUD 400. The only reason i was convinced to pay the money was the changes i saw in my friend who was the one pitching the \u201cbusiness\u201d to me.  In a few months since i had last met him, it seemed like he had a different personality. And when he started going off about personal development, i thought maybe i will give it a try. But i later found out that he was completely brain washed by his mentors, he had even given his mentors his Netbank details, to help him clear his debt, i told him back then as well that, you\u2019re still the one earning the money to pay the debt not your mentor, so don\u2019t give him your bank details, but he trusted them blindly.  I later found out that any materials they give you to read, listen or watch is designed to further their agenda. As mentioned by the OP, they meet in all formal attire, praise each other for getting more victims and act all pretentious. I was added to a facebook group for all the new recruits, but all i saw there was that they were targeting newcomers from Nepal and giving them false hope and leaving them $ 400 poorer, this was the final nail for me and i told my friend that i was quitting.  He gave me various reasons to carry on and any reasoning i gave he had an answer for. This just showed that how he was trained to face this type of situation. But my friend is still at it, probably has a steady stream of income by now, but at what price? I occasionally ask him \u2018how\u2019s the business going?\u2019 and he say that its alright and thats the extent of our talk on Amway.  This turned out longer than i intended, but please be aware of these schemes, do your own research and try to find out what you\u2019re getting into.",

Life has been tough recently, and I\u2019m struggling to find joy or purpose in anything. Even when I\u2019m around people, I still feel this deep sense of isolation, like I don\u2019t truly belong anywhere.  I\u2019ve tried reaching out to friends and family, but it\u2019s hard to open up fully. I don\u2019t want to burden anyone with my problems, and I worry they won\u2019t understand or might judge me. I know this isn\u2019t the healthiest mindset, but it\u2019s how I feel right now.  I\u2019m posting here in hopes of finding some support and maybe connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences. How do you cope with feelings of loneliness and depression? What steps can I take to start feeling better and more connected to the world around me? ",

            "I'm 19. I used to feel like that, but i have grown out of it recently. I also had no one to talk to, including my parents. I used to spend my time indoors watching anime, youtube,etc. On a normal day, i would spend like 8-10 hrs on my phone. Recently , i started to use my phone less and less, and it has made me happier. I dont know if it's placebo or something, but after hearing from multiple people from youtube, i finally decreased my screentime and social media usage, and honestly, i have never felt this good in a long time. I have improved sleep. I learned new skills like riding a bike and drawing, and i am learning spanish right now because i have nothing else to do after finishing my 12th. I've also started taking care of my body and exercising regularly. I randomly just show up to my friend's house, whom i am comfortable with ( which is 2 of my friends).   Try it, and if you need someone to talk to, we can  talk right here.   Hope you grow out of this phase. Good luck.",

For my case,   at first it seems ineffective, but meditation is very powerful, try to keep yourself busy, read book   especially philosophy help me a lot. It teaches you what is life and what is its purpose.   nothing matters so live a life and don't give a F\\*ck.   Share everything yet share nothing. If you think they are going to judge, it doesn't matter.   DGAF   and it is your stage where you are transitioning from teen to adult. So, it is normal to feel that way ig.
